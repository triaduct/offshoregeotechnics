Most notes or books just go through the concepts on a surficial level, and hopefully by going through the actually *execution* of design methods or analytical models this will hopefully give you a more granular understanding (excuse the pun!) of the different concepts. This comes in addition to workshops during the course itself. \n\n**Knowing Python is not a pre-requisite to using these notes**, and I hope the notes provide enough quality information beyond Python so that they're still useful. Where Python code has been included, it will be structured in such a way to make it very straightforward to change the inputs. Just note that `utils` is a directory that contains some useful helper scripts. these mainly come from the package CPyT (https://github.com/triaduct/cpyt), although I haven't had a chance to improve the documentation and add CPyT to PyPi--so `utils` will have to do for now. \n\nBeyond these Python scripts, there's also the notes themselves, the code outputs, along with other interactive elements. \n\n\n## How to access, edit and save notebooks\nA notebook is convenient way of including some explanatory text and Python code in one file. Therefore, this website consists of either a stand-alone Markdown file (which is basically [a fancy text file](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/markdown_guide.ipynb)) or a combined Markdown/Python notebook—known as Jupyter. \n\n### Google Colab\nWhere there's some coding elements in the notes, I've included a Google Colab button at the top of the page like this:\n\n[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb){target=\"_blank\"} <nbsp>\n\nWhat is Colab? Colab is a super easy way of editing the notes yourself on your browser. It also **doesn't require you to install Python on your computer**. You can simply click on the link above it will enable you to make whatever changes you want and run it right there straight away.\n\nYou do not need a Google account to interact with the notebooks. However if you would like to save your changes, you first need to save a copy to a Google Drive. Then you can edit and save changes to your own version.\n\n### Github\nFurthermore, all of these files are available at <https://github.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics> and you can copy them to your own computer. Github is based on a version control system called Git, making it easier to collaborate with others and track changes effectively. Therefore when copying these notes, you have a couple of choices:\n\n* You can **fork** the repository: this is recommended if you want to propose changes (always welcome!) or compare your fork with new updates to the notes.\n* You can **download** a zip file of the code. If you've got limited experience with Python and just want to make some small changes to the code, I'd recommended this. \n\nI've also include a few helper scripts in the `utils` directory. To run the code for the first time, this needs to be installed on the computer by:\n\n::: {#fb56cd90 .cell execution_count=1}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n!pip install git+https://github.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCollecting git+https://github.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics\n  Cloning https://github.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics to c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\temp\\pip-req-build-mollv915\n  Resolved https://github.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics to commit fe470c1310a64eb1250f615142029673afb3dd15\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py): started\n  Preparing metadata (setup.py): finished with status 'done'\nRequirement already satisfied: matplotlib in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from utils==1.0) (3.7.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: numpy in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from utils==1.0) (1.24.3)\nRequirement already satisfied: contourpy>=1.0.1 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (1.0.5)\nRequirement already satisfied: cycler>=0.10 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (0.11.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: fonttools>=4.22.0 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (4.25.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: kiwisolver>=1.0.1 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (1.4.4)\nRequirement already satisfied: packaging>=20.0 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (23.1)\nRequirement already satisfied: pillow>=6.2.0 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (9.4.0)\nRequirement already satisfied: pyparsing<3.1,>=2.3.1 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (3.0.9)\nRequirement already satisfied: python-dateutil>=2.7 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from matplotlib->utils==1.0) (2.8.2)\nRequirement already satisfied: six>=1.5 in c:\\users\\kduffy\\appdata\\local\\anaconda3\\lib\\site-packages (from python-dateutil>=2.7->matplotlib->utils==1.0) (1.16.0)\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nI've also included this is code blocks throughout\n\n### Quarto\nThese notes have been developed using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/). Quarto provides a really efficient way of making notes, webpages, presentations (to name but a few), all from the same set of notebooks. When I get a chance, I'll add a short guide to rendering the notes yourself into a custom .pdf or .html (website). But in the meantime, feel free to ask me any questions about it.\n\nI've also taken inspiration from several other Quarto webpages for developing these, so particular thanks to [Adam Spiegler](https://aspiegler.github.io/Exploring-Differential-Equations/) and [Jon Cardoso](https://github.com/jonjoncardoso/quarto-template-for-university-courses) for the inspiration. \n\n\n## Asking questions\n\nAt the bottom of each page, you'll see a small comment box. This comment box is connected with Github Discussions [in the course notes repository](https://github.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics/discussions) and so **all comments are public**. \n\nYou can use this comment box to ask questions about the course notes themselves or provide comments or suggestions (which are much welcome!). Hopefully this will also give others a chance to learn a bit more or give them a bit of inspiration—and I'd love to get ideas to improve these notes.\n\nOtherwise feel free to contact me (Kevin) directly at k.duffy@tudelft.nl. If you'd also like advice on using these materials for your course, please let me know if I can help. \n\n",
