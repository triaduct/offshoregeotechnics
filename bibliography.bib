  abstract = {The importance of wireless sensor networks in structural health monitoring is unceasingly growing, because of the increasing demand for both safety and security in the cities. The speedy growth of wireless technologies has considerably developed the progress of structural monitoring systems with the combination of wireless sensor network technology. Wireless sensor network--based structural health monitoring system introduces a novel technology with compelling advantages in comparison to traditional wired system, which has the benefits of reducing installation and maintenance costs of structural health monitoring systems. However, structural health monitoring has brought an additional complex challenges in network design to wireless sensor networks. This article presents a contemporary review of collective experience the researchers have gained from the application of wireless sensor networks for structural health monitoring. Technologies of wired and wireless sensor systems are investigated along with wireless sensor node architecture, functionality, communication technologies, and its popular operating systems. Then, comprehensive summaries for the state-of-the-art academic and commercial wireless platform technologies used in laboratory testbeds and field test deployments for structural health monitoring applications are reviewed and tabulated. Following that, classification taxonomy of the key challenges associated with wireless sensor networks for structural health monitoring to assist the researchers in understanding the obstacles and the suitability of implementing wireless technology for structural health monitoring applications are deeply discussed with available research efforts in order to overcome these challenges. Finally, open research issues in wireless sensor networks for structural health monitoring are explored.},

  abstract = {This document describes the test program that was conducted in 2021 to investigate the influence of grout injection parameters on the shaft bearing capacity of screw displacement piles. Grout variants considered were water/cement ratio, blend composition and flow rate. This resulted in 5 groups of 3 test piles with more or less the same grout parameters. Other installation parameters were kept constant. Back flow grout was sampled to determine composition and properties. Static load tests in tension until failure were used to determine the shaft bearing capacity of the test piles. In total 7 out of 15 test piles were extracted afterwards to establish the pile diameter. Also the annulus of the extracted piles was cored with the purpose to obtain the shear properties of the grout/concrete interface of the piles. It can be concluded that the range of water/cement ratio's applied in the test program did not have a substantial influence on the bearing capacity of the test piles and that the applied highest grout flowrate seemed to be at the limit of becoming influential. Furthermore it was found that the empirical cone resistance factor for shaft resistance ({$\alpha$}t according NEN 9997-1) is in compliance with the generic value of 0.009 for sand layers for this type of pile, provided that a limit value of 15 MPa for the cone resistance qc is not applied and provided that the shaft bearing capacity is computed based on the outer diameter of the screw tip.},

  abstract = {Currently, polymer modified asphalt mixture is a relatively costly mixture for paving roads. One way to reduce the cost of such constructions and rendering them more convenient is by using inexpensive polymers, i.e. waste polymers. The main purpose of this research is to determine the effect of incorporating waste plastic bottles (Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)) on the engineering properties of stone mastic asphalt (SMA) mixture. The volumetric and mechanical properties of asphalt mixes that include various percentages of PET (0\%, 2\%, 4\%, 6\%, 8\% and 10\%) were calculated and assessed with laboratory tests. The appropriate amount of PET was found to be 6\% by weight of bitumen. The outcomes were statistically analysed and the determination of the significance at certain confidence limits was performed with the two factor variance analysis (ANOVA). Moreover, some studies conducted on polyethylene modified asphalt mixture have also been taken into consideration in this paper. The results show that the addition of PET has a significant positive effect on the properties of SMA and it can promote the re-use of waste material in industry in an environmentally friendly and economical way.},

Analyses are performed for two-layer soils composed of either sands with different relative densities or different materials (sand and clay). Parametric numerical modeling is used to determine the distance that a cone senses a new upcoming soil layer interface or a layer interface behind. Analyses are also carried out for a thin sand layer embedded in soft clay. It is seen that the full tip resistance may not be reached in thin stiff layers. This is especially true for penetration in thin dense sand layers interbedded in softer clay. A correction factor is suggested to correct the cone tip resistance in thin sand layers. The higher the stiffness and the thinner the layer, the larger the correction factor. The numerical results obtained in this paper are in good agreement with experimental observations. Some limitations of a previously proposed correction factor are discussed.Key words: cone tip resistance, modeling, sand, clay, interface influence distance, layering.}

This chapter explains the physical meaning of the water--cement (w/c) and water--binder (w/b) ratios, the nature of Portland cement, and how it hydrates. The numerical values of the w/c and w/b ratios are directly related to the distance separating the cementitious particles in a cement paste when the hydration process starts. These ratios directly impact the ultimate porosity, density, and mechanical properties of concrete. The lower these ratios are, the stronger, more durable, and more sustainable the concrete will be. Therefore, superplasticizers, which allow the production of concrete with lower water content without compromising workability, have opened the doors to radical improvements in concrete performance. In such concrete, there is not enough water for complete hydration, so compressive strength continues to increase as the w/c or w/b ratio decreases.},

Carbon emissions are incurred in all stages of a building's life cycle and are generally categorised into operating carbon and embodied carbon, each making varying contributions to the life cycle carbon depending on the building's characteristics. With recent advances in reducing the operating carbon of buildings, the available literature indicates a clear shift in attention towards investigating strategies to minimize embodied carbon. However, minimizing the embodied carbon of buildings is challenging and requires evaluating the effects of embodied carbon reduction strategies on the emissions incurred in different life cycle phases, as well as the operating carbon of the building. In this paper, the available literature on strategies for reducing the embodied carbon of buildings, as well as methods for estimating the embodied carbon of buildings, is reviewed and the strengths and weaknesses of each method are highlighted.},

A correlation between the relative density and PFFP's maximum deceleration was developed from controlled PFFP deployments into sand of different relative densities. Two approaches were tested: (i) a correlation between relative density and friction angle and (ii) bearing capacity theory. For the former, laboratory vacuum triaxial tests were performed to adjust an existing correlation between relative density and friction angle for the tested nearshore sediments. In situ peak friction angles were then determined using this adjusted correlation and estimates of relative densities. The resulting in situ relative density and friction angle varied between 32\%--88\% and 44{$^\circ$}--56{$^\circ$}, respectively. Two bearing capacity--based methods suitable for shallow penetrations were tested. For this approach, equivalents of static cone resistance were determined from the measured decelerations considering the strain rate effect. A range of empirical strain rate coefficients K = 0.1--1.5 were tested. A K value between 0.2 and 0.4 yielded matching results between the two approaches. The estimated friction angles agreed well with expected values and may be applied to problems of sediment transport or early site assessment.},

It is shown that the shaft capacity measured shortly after installation reduces systematically with the logarithm of the number of impact blows or jacking increments per unit shaft area imparted during installation. However, the degree of set-up of shaft friction for piles increases with an increase in the number of blows, and piles installed using a large number of blows can attain highest ``long-term'' shaft capacities, despite having the lowest short-term capacity. The tests indicated that the driving impact frequency had a relatively small influence on shaft friction, while piles installed by vibration attain short-term capacities comparable to driven impact piles, but showed negative set-up.},

  abstract = {Transport and other infrastructure systems are supported on, adjacent to and retained by extensive systems of earthworks of varying (and increasing) age, and of variable original construction quality. These earthworks are subject to natural deterioration, which can be accelerated and complicated by the effects of climate change. The ACHILLES research program is providing improved understanding of earthworks behavior, performance and deterioration. It is also developing methods and tools to analyze and provide decision support for the construction, maintenance and renewal of earthworks, with particular emphasis on the management of existing, deteriorating assets. The work described here aims to identify the most cost-effective timing and means of extending earthworks asset lives and maintaining their safety and serviceability. Conventional cost-benefit analysis methods, of the type used for new infrastructure projects, do not directly provide the decision support needed for the maintenance and renewal of existing earthworks assets. An alternative approach is proposed and applied to a modeled example, demonstrating the potential asset management benefits of early, pre-emptive intervention, the economic attraction of deferred intervention, and the means of identifying an intermediate whole-life cost `sweet spot', based on a timely assessment of intervention options. The handling of the uncertainty associated with earthworks behavior, deterioration rates and times to failure is also considered, as is the extension of the single-asset approach to the management of multiple earthworks assets.},

  abstract = {The problem of cone penetration, particularly deep penetration, remains one of the most challenging in geotechnical engineering. It involves large displacements, rotations and deformation of soil elements in the path of the cone as well as complex response of the soil, including crushing and the development of large mean stresses, to the displacements imposed by the penetration process. As a result, rigorous theoretical solutions are not available for this problem, and experimental simulations of penetration provide insights that would not otherwise be available. This paper presents the results of a series of cone penetration tests performed in a half-circular chamber in sand samples prepared with three silica sands with different crushability. Cone resistance was measured, and digital images of the cone penetrating into the sand samples were acquired simultaneously during the entire penetration process. The digital image correlation (DIC) technique was then used to process these images to obtain the soil displacement field resulting from cone penetration. The results of DIC analyses and measured cone resistance suggest that the soil displacement around an advancing cone depends on the density and crushability of the sand, as well as the depth of penetration. Tests on silica sands with different degrees of crushability show that, for shallow penetration, the displacement vectors near the cone tip are essentially vertical for crushable sand, transitioning to subvertical for less crushable sands. However, for deep penetration, the displacement vectors near the cone tip are mostly vertical below the cone tip. Crushing was observed immediately below and around the cone tip for all sands tested. After passage of the cone, the crushed particles form a thin, crushed particle band of thickness equal to about 2{$\cdot$}5D50 along the shaft, with a smaller percentage of crushed particles observed within an outer band with thickness equal to 4D50.},

  abstract = {Soil stress-strain behaviour is highly non-linear and this has an important influence on the selection of design parameters for simple routine geotechnical calculations. Non-linear behaviour can be characterized by rigidity and degree of non-linearity and these can be determined from measurements of very small strain-stiffness, peak strength and failure strain. Very small strain-stiffness can be found from measurements of shear wave velocity in situ or in laboratory tests. Peak strength and failure strain can be measured in routine laboratory tests but are strongly influenced by initiation of shear bands. The important non-linear stiffness parameters for soil are related to its composition and to its current state. Back-analyses of the load settlement behaviour of full-scale and model foundations demonstrate the influence of non-linear soil behaviour. Variations of stiffness with settlement calculated from full-scale and model foundations agree well with non-linear soil stiffnesses based on rigidity and degree of non-linearity. These results suggest a simple method for routine design which takes account of soil non-linear stiffness.},

  abstract = {The Late Pleistocene Wijchen Member (WM) and its informal stratigraphic precursors have been recognized for decades in the Rhine-Meuse Valley of the Netherlands. Although the WM marks the top of the Kreftenheye Formation (KF) at the boundary between Pleistocene and Holocene lithofacies and provides a confining bed for the regional alluvial aquifer, significant issues remain regarding WM depositional environment and processes of sedimentation. Regional WM chronology suggests a time-transgressive, millennium scale response of the Rhine River to Lateglacial climate oscillations. This paper compares interpretations of sedimentation process, stratigraphic pattern, and paleoenvironmental significance to prevailing viewpoints on the WM mode of origin.A flood basin in the Over Betuwe between the channel belts of the Neder Rijn and River Waal is investigated to characterize WM stratigraphy. The KF braided stream deposits (Kb) form a regionally extensive sandy to gravelly lithofacies. As Kb aggradation ceased, fluvial channels incised into local braid plain swales. The WM was deposited during episodes of fluvial activity as a suspended load mud drape across segments of the abandoned braid plain. The WM is a gray silty lithofacies that also contains local admixtures of sand. Explanations for the origin of the sand admixed into the mud include variability in hydrodynamic load across the flood plain, eolian mixing, and/or biogenic mixing. In the study area, eolian deposition of sand onto a wet flood plain surface is the most probable cause for the admixed sand fraction. Pedogenesis of the WM in the study area is limited to gleying under reduced wetland conditions and the development of organic rich vegetation horizons that formed on top of relatively unaltered fluvial strata. Similar reduced soil properties and limited pedogenic development occur downdip to the present coast, but updip of the study area, the WM is the parent material for poorly drained to well drained and oxidized profiles that range from Entisols to weakly expressed Alfisols.The presence of pumice granules in Kb deposits of the study area indicate that channel belt deposition continued after the Laacher See volcanic eruption in Germany at {\textasciitilde}12,900 cal yr. Deposition of the WM occurred episodically throughout the Lateglacial and terminated by the early Holocene. The time interval between the end of WM deposition and subsequent burial by flood basin peat reflects a duration of exposure of at least 3500 yrs. Since regional water table rise affected the area {\textasciitilde}5000 cal yrs ago, the early Holocene water table must have been maintained by spring fed ground water sources from nearby ice pushed ridges.Deposition of the WM is associated with transitional braided to meandering fluvial channels during times when the Rhine-Meuse Valley experienced a sensitive response to rapid climate change. The WM is regionally time transgressive and probably formed during flood plain transitions between permafrost and base-flow driven hydrologic regimes. Regional landscape dynamics suggest that WM deposition and subsequent preservation was driven by fluctuations of the southern limit of permafrost during Northern Hemisphere deglaciation.},

However, it is not feasible to replace all the infrastructural assets that have surpassed their service lives. The commonly established alternative is increasing their durability by means of Structural Health Monitoring (SHM)-based maintenance and serviceability. Amongst the multitude of approaches to SHM, the Digital Twin model is gaining increasing attention. This model is a digital reconstruction (the Digital Twin) of a real-life asset (the Physical Twin) that, in contrast to other digital models, is frequently and automatically updated using data sampled by a sensor network deployed on the latter. This tool can provide infrastructure managers with functionalities to monitor and optimize their asset stock and to make informed and data-based decisions, in the context of day-to-day operative conditions and after extreme events. These data not only include sensor data, but also include regularly revalidated structural reliability indices formulated on the grounds of the frequently updated Digital Twin model. The technology can be even pushed as far as performing structural behavioral predictions and automatically compensating for them. The present exploratory review covers the key Digital Twin aspects---its usefulness, modus operandi, application, etc.---and proves the suitability of Distributed Sensing as its network sensor component.},

  abstract = {Although Paleogene warm climatic intervals have received considerable attention for atmospheric and oceanographic changes, the authigenic mineralization associated with these time spans remains overlooked. An extensive review of the literature reveals a close correspondence between the high abundance of glauconite and warm climatic intervals during the Paleogene period. The abundance of phosphorite, ironstone, lignite and black shale deposits reveals similar trends. Although investigated thoroughly, the origin of these authigenic deposits is never understood in the background of Paleogene warming climatic intervals. A combination of factors like warm seawater, hypoxic shelf, low rate of sedimentation, and enhanced rate of continental weathering facilitated the glauconitization. The last factor caused the excess supply of nutrients, including Fe, Si, K, Mg and Al through the rivers, the cations needed for the formation of glauconite. The excessive inflow of nutrient-rich freshwater into the shallow seas further ensured high organic productivity and stratification in shallow shelves, causing hypoxia. The consequent rapid rise in sea-level during the warm periods created extensive low-relief shallow marine shelves starved in sediments. Oxygen-deficiency in the shallow marine environment facilitated the fixation of Fe into the glauconite structure. The inflow of nutrient-rich water during the warm climatic intervals facilitated the formation of phosphorite, ironstone, and organic-matter-rich sedimentary deposits as well. Although global factors primarily controlled the formation of these authigenic deposits, local factors played significant roles in some of the deposits. Therefore, phosphorites formed in marine conditions with open circulation within the tropical zone. While lush growth of rainforest covers in the tropical belt facilitated the formation of coastal lignite.},

  abstract = {The needs to assess robust performances for complex systems and to answer tighter regulatory processes (security, safety, environmental control, and health impacts, etc.) have led to the emergence of a new industrial simulation challenge: to take uncertainties into account when dealing with complex numerical simulation frameworks. Therefore, a generic methodology has emerged from the joint effort of several industrial companies and academic institutions. EDF R\&D, Airbus Group and Phimeca Engineering started a collaboration at the beginning of 2005, joined by IMACS in 2014, for the development of an Open Source software platform dedicated to uncertainty propagation by probabilistic methods, named OpenTURNS for Open source Treatment of Uncertainty, Risk 'N Statistics. OpenTURNS addresses the specific industrial challenges attached to uncertainties, which are transparency, genericity, modularity and multi-accessibility. This paper focuses on OpenTURNS and presents its main features: openTURNS is an open source software under the LGPL license, that presents itself as a C++ library and a Python TUI, and which works under Linux and Windows environment. All the methodological tools are described in the different sections of this paper: uncertainty quantification, uncertainty propagation, sensitivity analysis and metamodeling. A section also explains the generic wrappers way to link openTURNS to any external code. The paper illustrates as much as possible the methodological tools on an educational example that simulates the height of a river and compares it to the height of a dyke that protects industrial facilities. At last, it gives an overview of the main developments planned for the next few years.},

Plastic content of 10\% by weight of bitumen is  recommended for the improvement of the performance  of Stone Mastic Asphalt mixtures. 10\% plastic content  gives an increase in the stability, split tensile strength  and compressive strength of about 64\%, 18\% and 75\%  respectively compared to the conventional SMA mix.  Triaxial test results show a 44\% increase in cohesion  and 3\% decrease in angle of shearing resistance  showing an increase in the shear strength.

  abstract = {A large number of lithological borehole descriptions, 14C dates, archaeological artefacts, and gradients of palaeochannels were used to reconstruct the Holocene development of the Rhine--Meuse delta. Data were stored in a Geographical Information System database that enables generation of palaeogeographical maps for any time during the Holocene. The time resolution of the palaeogeographic reconstruction is about 200years. During the Holocene, avulsion was an important process, resulting in frequent shifts of areas of clastic sedimentation. Palaeogeographic evolution of the Rhine--Meuse delta is mainly governed by complex interactions among several factors. These are: (1) Location and shape of the Late Weichselian palaeovalley. (2) Sea-level rise, which resulted in back-filling of the palaeovalley. (3) Peat formation, which was most extensive in the western part of the back-barrier area especially between 4000 and 300014CyrBP. This more or less fixed the river pattern at that time and resulted in few avulsions. (4) Neotectonics. Differential tectonic movements of the Peel Horst and Roer Valley Graben seem to have influenced river behaviour (formation of an asymmetrical meander belt, location of avulsion nodes), especially from 4500 to 280014CyrBP when the rate of sea-level rise had decreased. After 280014CyrBP, the sea-level rise further decreased, and the tectonic influence still may have influenced avulsions, but from then on, other factors became dominant. (5) Increased discharge, sediment load and/or within-channel sedimentation. After 280014CyrBP, river meanders of Rhine distributaries as well as the single channel of the Meuse show remarkable increases in wavelength, interpreted as a result of increased bankfull discharge and sediment load. Increased discharge may initially have been caused by a higher precipitation. After 200014CyrBP, both discharge and sediment load seem to have increased as a result of human influence. Alternatively, decreasing gradients (as a result of sea-level rise) may have caused an increased within-channel sedimentation and channel widening, which would also lead to increased meander wavelengths. (6) Composition of the river banks. Meandering river channels tend to adhere to the sandy margins of the Late Weichselian palaeovalley, and a high channel sinuosity is found in areas where river banks consist of sand. (7) Marine ingressions, e.g., the AD1421 St. Elizabeth's flood, caused large-scale erosion in the southwestern part of the fluvial deltaic plain. (8) Human influence. Since about AD1100 human influence dominated the palaeogeographic evolution. Rivers were embanked and dredged, meanders were cut off, and for the Meuse, a new distributary canal (the Bergsche Maas) was dug in AD1904. Discharge distribution over the various channels is strictly controlled nowadays. An unusual feature of the delta is the prolonged existence of the Oude Rijn channel belt.},

In the past 20 years the use of fibre-optic Distributed Temperature Sensing (DTS) in dams has proved to be an effective tool for the detection of leakages and internal erosion. This work investigates the effectiveness of DTS for dike monitoring, focusing on the early detection of backward erosion piping, a mechanism that affects the foundation layer of structures resting on permeable, sandy soils. The paper presents data from a piping test performed on a large-scale experimental dike equipped with a DTS system together with a large number of accompanying sensors. The effect of seepage and piping on the temperature field is analysed, eventually identifying the processes that cause the onset of thermal anomalies around piping channels and thus enable their early detection. Making use of dimensional analysis, the factors that influence this thermal response of a dike foundation are identified. Finally some tools are provided that can be helpful for the design of monitoring systems and for the interpretation of temperature data.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

However, many sites encountered in practice contain both sand and clay layers as well as silt layers and it is therefore important to assess the reliability of these new methods at such sites. This paper presents this assessment using a newly compiled database of pile load tests in interlayered deposits. It is shown that satisfactory predictions of capacities are attained using the sand and clay formulations of the `unified' method with a correction applied to the sand method to enable prediction of shaft friction in silt deposits.},

The ability to re-use helical piles and recent interest in their use as foundations in offshore wind and solar energy applications has renewed interest in improving existing design methods. This paper presents the results from field investigations in medium dense and dense sand that examine effects on the axial tension and compression capacity of varying the helix pitch, shaft diameter, advancement ratio and shaft tip geometry. The results from the 20 pile tests conducted (many of which included instrumentation) indicate low sensitivity to a range of the investigated parameters and a strong correlation of the capacity to the cone penetration test (CPT) resistance. A design method based on these findings is proposed for typical helical pile geometries and is shown to provide predictions that are generally within 10 to 15\% of the axial capacities reported for 30 other well documented pile tests reported in the literature. The method, referred to as UWASP-22, incorporates a simple means of estimating the load-displacement response of a helical pile as well as a formulation enabling prediction of the installation torque which is a common quality control measure for helical piles.},

  abstract = {Ageing of shaft friction is now an accepted characteristic of displacement piles in sand. However, there is little guidance available on how the associated gains in pile capacity can be incorporated in design. This paper provides an overview of findings from a number of previous high-quality investigations before presenting results from a recent pile testing campaign in the field that targeted aspects of pile ageing to improve understanding of the ageing mechanism. The field testing involved 52 tension tests on pipe piles and specifically examined the influence of installation method (driving, vibration, vibration{$\mkern1mu$}+{$\mkern1mu$}driving), pile diameter, steel type and loading history (static and cyclic). These results, taken together with other experimental investigations, show that the development of a welded crust on the pile shaft is a necessary part of the ageing process for steel piles and that the increase with time in the level of constrained dilation under shear on this crust is a primary contributor to ageing of shaft friction. Creep within the sand mass following the disturbance induced by installation can explain the increase in the level of this constraint, while stress redistribution and breakdown of arching may also contribute to the phenomenon. Ageing leads to the inference of instances of long-term aged shaft friction (in tension) of 500\,mm and 2\,m dia. pipe piles that are, respectively, at least 50\% and 30\% higher than given by the design method in ISO 19901-4 (2024). Additional observations relating to the effect of the installation method, steel type and load history on the ageing of shaft friction, which could assist designers.},

Aside from enhancing the efficiency of the value chain, such information-intensive models and associated technologies play a decisive role in minimising the lifecycle impacts of our buildings. While Building Information Modelling provides procedures, technologies and data schemas enabling a standardised semantic representation of building components and systems, the concept of a Digital Twin conveys a more holistic socio-technical and process-oriented characterisation of the complex artefacts involved by leveraging the synchronicity of the cyber-physical bi-directional data flows. Moreover, BIM lacks semantic completeness in areas such as control systems, including sensor networks, social systems, and urban artefacts beyond the scope of buildings, thus requiring a holistic, scalable semantic approach that factors in dynamic data at different levels. The paper reviews the multi-faceted applications of BIM during the construction stage and highlights limits and requirements, paving the way to the concept of a Construction Digital Twin. A definition of such a concept is then given, described in terms of underpinning research themes, while elaborating on areas for future research.},

  abstract = {The Paper describes a series of field experiments using extensively instrumented closed-ended steel piles installed in heavily overconsolidated London clay. Each pile was equipped to measure the effective stresses acting at the pile/soil interface during the three main stages of the pile's lifetime: installation, the subsequent period of earth and pore water pressure equalization, and pile loading. The Paper presents the results obtained during installation and equalization. The results differ in several important respects from the response predicted by current theories of pile behaviour. The rate of penetration of the piles during installation had a marked influence on the skin friction that could be mobilized during installation and in subsequent load tests. Residual shear surfaces were created near the pile wall and these controlled the piles' overall shaft capacity. The measured interface stresses were much larger than expected; they depended to a marked extent on position relative to the pile tip. The load capacity of the piles showed no increase with time and appeared to fall slightly.

Results of prior studies of cone penetration in layered soil profiles are utilized for developing and evaluating the inverse filtering procedure. The inverse filtering procedure has three primary components: (1) a model for how the cone penetrometer acts as a low-pass spatial filter in sampling the true distribution of soil resistance versus depth, (2) a solution procedure for iteratively determining an estimate of the true cone penetration resistance profile from the measured profile given the cone penetration filter model, and (3) a procedure for identifying sharp transition interfaces and correcting the data at those interfaces. The details of the inverse filtering procedure presented herein were developed with a focus on liquefaction problems, but the concepts and framework should be applicable to other problems. Example applications of the inverse filtering procedure are presented for four CPT soundings illustrative of a range of soil profile characteristics. The proposed procedure provides an objective, repeatable, and automatable means for correcting cone penetration test data for thin-layer and transition zone effects.},

  abstract = {Skip to Next Section Recent peat slope failures in Ireland in the autumn of 2003 at Pollatomish, County Mayo and Derrybrien, County Galway have focused attention on such events. However, slope failures involving peat are not a recent phenomenon, and possible evidence of peat failures in Ireland has been identified as far back as the Early Bronze Age. This paper summarizes the issues surrounding peat slope failure in Ireland that would be of interest to an engineer or engineering geologist assessing this geohazard. The distribution of peat throughout Ireland, its formation, and its typical characteristic properties are discussed. A review of historical failures shows that there is a relationship between run-out distance and failure volume, and that the majority of the failures are clustered at slope angles between 4{$^\circ$} and 8{$^\circ$}. It seems that the risk of fatalities from peat slides is relatively low. The likely casual factors of peat slope failure are presented using examples including the recent failures at Pollatomish and Derrybrien, both of which have been investigated by the authors. Particular attention is paid to shear strength properties of peat and the applicability of traditional soil mechanics. Given the uncertainties that exist about peat strength, a cautious approach to slope stability assessment is advocated together with identification of potential causal factors to mitigate against this geohazard.},

  abstract = {Recent work has shown that adaptively reweighting the training set, growing a classifier using the new weights, and combining the classifiers constructed to date can significantly decrease generalization error. Procedures of this type were called arcing by Breiman[1996]. The first successful arcing procedure was introduced by Freund and Schapire[1995,1996] and called Adaboost. In an effort to explain why Adaboost works, Schapire et.al. [1997] derived a bound on the generalization error of a convex combination of classifiers in terms of the margin. We introduce a function called the edge, which differs from the margin only if there are more than two classes. A framework for understanding arcing algorithms is defined. In this framework, we see that the arcing algorithms currently in the literature are optimization algorithms which minimize some function of the edge. A relation is derived between the optimal reduction in the maximum value of the edge and the PAC concept of weak learner. Two algorithms are described which achieve the optimal reduction. Tests on both synthetic and real data cast doubt on the Schapire et.al. explanation.},

The generalization error for forests converges a.s. to a limit as the number of trees in the forest becomes large. The generalization error of a forest of tree classifiers depends on the strength of the individual trees in the forest and the correlation between them. Using a random selection of features to split each node yields error rates that compare favorably to Adaboost (Y. Freund \& R. Schapire, Machine Learning: Proceedings of the Thirteenth International conference, ***, 148--156), but are more robust with respect to noise. Internal estimates monitor error, strength, and correlation and these are used to show the response to increasing the number of features used in the splitting. Internal estimates are also used to measure variable importance. These ideas are also applicable to regression.},

These curves are modeled by hyperbolas which start at the residual friction and residual point pressure for zero displacement. The design method is based on a simple theory and a 33-pile data base. Since each pile had sufficient instrumentation and a sufficiently complete load test program, the residual stresses and transfer curves could be determined with reasonable accuracy from the data base.},

  abstract = {Effective Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) often requires continuous monitoring to capture changes of features of interest in structures, which are often located far from power sources. A key challenge lies in continuous low-power data transmission from sensors. Despite significant developments in long-range, low-power telecommunication (e.g., LoRa NB-IoT), there are inadequate demonstrative benchmarks for low-power SHM. Damage detection is often based on monitoring features computed from acceleration signals where data are extensive due to the frequency of sampling ({\textasciitilde}100--500 Hz). Low-power, long-range telecommunications are restricted in both the size and frequency of data packets. However, microcontrollers are becoming more efficient, enabling local computing of damage-sensitive features. This paper demonstrates the implementation of an Edge-SHM framework through low-power, long-range, wireless, low-cost and off-the-shelf components. A bespoke setup is developed with a low-power MEM accelerometer and a microcontroller where frequency and time domain features are computed over set time intervals before sending them to a cloud platform. A cantilever beam excited by an electrodynamic shaker is monitored, where damage is introduced through the controlled loosening of bolts at the fixed boundary, thereby introducing rotation at its fixed end. The results demonstrate how an IoT-driven edge platform can benefit continuous monitoring.},

  abstract = {High-resolution continuous core material, geophysical measurements, and hundreds of archived core descriptions enabled to identify 13 Late Pleistocene Rhine-Meuse sedimentary units in the infill of the southern part of the North Sea basin (the Netherlands, northwestern Europe). This sediment record and a large set of Optical Stimulated Luminescence dates, 14C dates and biostratigraphical data, allowed to establish detailed relationships between climate change, sea-level oscillation, glaciation history and the sedimentary development of the Rhine fluvial system during the last glacial cycle (Marine Isotope Stages 5e-2, Eemian-Weichselian). A well-preserved Eemian sediment record was encountered as the infill of a Late Saalian (MIS6) subglacial basin. Part of this record reflects groundwater rise controlled (fine-grained) sedimentation as a result of postglacial (early) Eemian sea-level rise. It shows strong analogy to developments known from the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta. Outside of the glacial depressions near coastal deposits are only fragmentarily preserved. The Early Glacial Rhine sediment record is dominated by organic debris and peat layers, marking landscape stability and low fluvial activity. Part of this record may have been formed under near coastal conditions. Significant amounts of reworked marine biomarkers in the lag-deposits of Early Pleniglacial (MIS4) fluvial systems indicate that this period is characterized by extensive reworking of older (MIS5) near-coastal sediments. Despite the marked Early Pleniglacial climatic cooling, input of new sediment from the drainage basin was relatively low, a feature that is related to the presence of regolith protective relic soil complexes in the basin. During the early Middle Pleniglacial, a major Rhine avulsion indicates the system was in an aggrading mode and that sediment supply into the lower reaches of the Rhine had strongly increased. This increase in sediment supply coincided with the timing of major climate cooling that occurred from {$\sim$}50 to 45ka onwards. The increase in sediment supply is related to final breakup of the soil complexes in the drainage basin. After {$\sim$}24ka, a strong input of coarse-grained gravelly sediments was observed which indicates a strong increase in physical weathering processes and periglacial-controlled supply of bedload sediment in the catchment. A time delay between climate change ({$\sim$}30ka) and channel belt aggradation ({$<$}24ka), is explained as a result of transport path length between source and sink and/or effects of higher continental runoff rates after 22ka. The Late Middle Pleniglacial, Late Pleniglacial and Lateglacial Rhine-Meuse record testifies for strong influence of glacio-isostatic-controlled differential upwarping of the study area. Glacio-isostatic-controlled forebulge upwarping and lateral valley tilting is shown to have deflected Rhine-Meuse channel belts after 35ka. Glacio-isostatic upwarping is seen as the main cause for strong incision during the first phase of the Late Pleniglacial (30--24ka). At later stage glacio-isostatic-controlled incision was overruled due to high climate-controlled sediment input from the catchment and probably initial glacio-isostatic subsidence. Migration of channel belts towards the direction of the former centre of glacio-isostatic uplift indicates that glacio-isostacy influenced Rhine-Meuse paleogeography until far into the Lateglacial.},

  abstract = {Offshore pile driving is a high-risk activity as delays can be financially punitive. Experience of pile driving for offshore jacket structures where pile diameters are typically {$<$} 2\,m has led to the development of empirical pile driveability models with proven predictive capability. The application of these methods to larger diameter piles is uncertain. A major component of driveability models involves estimating the static resistance to driving, SRD, a parameter analogous to pile axial capacity. Recent research on axial capacity design has led to improved models that use Cone Penetration Test, CPT data to estimate pile capacity and include for the effects of friction fatigue and soil plugging. The applicability of these methods to estimating pile driveability for larger diameter piles is of interest. In this paper, recent CPT based axial capacity approaches, modified for mobilised base resistance and ageing, are applied to estimating driveability of 4.2\,m diameter piles. A database of pile installation records from North sea installations are used to benchmark the methods. Accounting for factors such as pile ageing and the relatively low displacement mobilised during individual hammer blows improves the quality of prediction of pile driveability for the conditions evaluated in this study.},

  abstract = {Geotechnical characterization of a project site often starts with desk-study and site reconnaissance, which provide site information available prior to the project (e.g., existing data in literature, engineering experience, and engineers' expertise). Such information can be used as ``prior knowledge'' under a Bayesian framework and be quantitatively reflected by a prior distribution in Bayesian methods. However, it is not a trivial task for engineering practitioners to properly quantify prior knowledge as a prior distribution. This paper develops two different methods to quantify prior knowledge during geotechnical characterization of a project site. Where there is no prevailing prior knowledge on the site, a non-informative prior distribution (e.g., uniform prior distribution) is used to reflect quantitatively the engineering common sense and judgment. As prior knowledge improves and becomes much more informative, a subjective probability assessment framework (SPAF) is proposed to estimate the prior distribution from prior knowledge. The proposed SPAF framework assists geotechnical engineers in formulating and expressing their engineering judgments in a quantifiable and transparent manner. These two different methods are illustrated using information from a sand site of the US National Geotechnical Experimentation Sites (NGES) at Texas A\&M University (TAMU).},

AI methods however still face limitations in their input of geophysical data towards output geotechnical data. We must bridge the gap between geophysical and geotechnical data by means of innovations. Small strain shear modulus Gmax is an important design driver of foundations of fixed offshore structures. It is currently lacking in state-of-the-art AI predictors. Besides the additional output parameter Gmax, the way forward is also to employ improved input parameters as a basis for the AI predictions and improved uncertainties of AI predictions. We succeeded to have the AI prediction process of Gmax to provide an approximation of relationships between seismic reflection data and new, highly relevant geotechnical data. Also we improved the AI predictive power of geotechnical data from geophysical data by the consistent and objective generation of watertight guiding soil units. Lastly, we produced a confidence interval methodology which finally honors and quantifies geophysical, geotechnical, geological and neural network uncertainties altogether.},

The static resistances derived from signal matching by two independent specialist teams using different software are compared with CPT-based pile capacity calculations, providing the first axial capacity and setup dataset for large offshore piles driven in sand. Complementary re-analyses are made from three onshore/nearshore sites where dynamic and static testing was conducted on comparable piles. Open-ended tubular steel piles with 0.3--3.5~m diameters driven in (mainly dense) sands are all shown to develop marked setup, which is most active over the first 2--10~days. All piles show similar outcomes 20--30~days after installation. However, the larger diameter offshore piles' dynamic tests indicate no further setup after 30~days, while smaller diameter piles at onshore/nearshore sites continue to display further marked capacity growth. Comparisons of the axial shaft capacities inferred from signal matching with CPT-based design methods provides insights into the performance of the design methods. A trend for long-term pile shaft set-up to decrease with increasing diameter is identified and ascribed principally to the diameter-dependent constrained dilatancy that develops under axial loading at the pile-sand interface.},

The undrained resistance is much lower than the drained resistance because the operational undrained shear strength is affected by the effective stresses around the pile tip during dynamic penetration which in turn are governed by hydraulic fracture and cavitation.},

  abstract = {Screw piles can be used as foundations for offshore energy applications, thanks to their silent mode of installation and considerable uplift capacity, although a significant upscaling of onshore dimensions is necessary. However, the crowd (vertical) force necessary to install upscaled screw piles was previously shown to be far too great for practical installation. Although guidance recommends that the pile's vertical displacement must be one helix pitch (helix height) per each pile revolution, it is shown in this paper that a lower vertical displacement per revolution can significantly reduce the necessary crowd force during installation or even generate some pull-in. In addition, it was shown that the uplift stiffness and capacity of the pile were enhanced by this installation process, at a shallow (relative) depth in sand. This paper gathers 19 centrifuge tests, with varying screw pile geometries (shaft diameter, base shape), sand relative density and advancement rates. A predictive framework for the pull-in potential of a given pile geometry was proposed to assess its ability to be installed with a reduced crowd force.},

  abstract = {This study utilises parallel discrete element method (DEM) simulations of cone penetration tests (CPTs) and pile load tests to investigate the application of direct CPT-based methods for predicting the base capacity of bored piles in layered soils. To reduce boundary effects, a coupled DEM-finite difference method (FDM) model is constructed to simulate pile load tests. The study focuses on the scale effect of pile diameter on the correction factor {$\alpha$}b and the effectiveness of existing qc averaging methods in layered soils. Two pile diameters and three soil layering conditions, featuring a single silt layer interbedded within sand at varying depths, are considered in the simulations. Results show that both soil layering and pile displacement influence the scale effect. At small settlements (s) up to 0.3 times the pile diameter (D), the scale effect is insignificant, except when a soft layer is directly above the pile tip. At larger settlements, particularly when s~{$>~$}0.5D, piles with smaller diameters show more pronounced reductions in base resistance due to a weak layer closely beneath the tip. Among the four methods evaluated, the BD-18 qc averaging method produces more consistent {$\alpha$}b values across various soil profiles and pile diameters. Microscopic analysis reveals that soils above the tip contribute less to the pile base resistance at s/D~=~0.1 than to the cone tip resistance. Additionally, the strength mobilisation levels of soils in most soil layering conditions appear similar at s/D~=~0.1, supporting the proposal of a constant {$\alpha$}b value in direct CPT-based methods.},

We use Bayesian statistics to estimate non-directly observable soil parameters from measured structural responses. These estimates are used to calculate the failure probability of the structure against serviceability and ultimate limit states before and after measurements. We study the impact of sensor installation time and the contribution of various sensor types to the change in failure probability. Nested sampling is used to compute the posterior distributions and to estimate the failure probabilities. The results show that SHM largely decreases the failure probability estimates compared to the prior value. The largest failure probability reduction is obtained when the monitoring starts right after the sheet pile wall is driven into the ground: about 1017{\texttimes} and larger reductions for the considered ultimate limit state. With each delay in the sensor installation time, the failure probability reduction can substantially decrease, in some cases 103{\texttimes} and larger reductions are observed. The results imply that SHM coupled with Bayesian statistics is a promising approach to substantially reduce our uncertainty in modeling hydraulic structures and, in turn, to increase their calculated safety.},

An assessment of new technologies including alternative transport fuels to break the dependence on petroleum is presented, although it appears that technological innovation is unlikely to be the sole answer to the climate change problem. To achieve a stabilisation of greenhouse gas emissions from transport, behavioural change brought about by policy will also be required. Pressure is growing on policy makers to tackle the issue of climate change with a view to providing sustainable transport.

Although it is widely known that soil properties are spatially correlated, the spatial correlation of qc is not considered in the current methods for predicting the bearing capacity of piles. In this paper, a probabilistic approach is presented for predicting the bearing capacity of driven piles in clay by considering the spatial correlation between qcsVn (the spatial average of qc of the bottom soil layer within the pile length) and qcbV (the spatial average of qc over an interval near the pile base). Parametric studies are conducted to evaluate the effect of the spatial correlation between qcsVn and qcbV on the bearing capacity of piles. The results indicate that it is important to consider the spatial correlation between qcsVn and qcbV in the probabilistic prediction of the bearing capacities of piles. Ignoring the spatial correlation between qcsVn and qcbV will underestimate the probability of failure and lead to unsafe design. Finally, 14 field test piles are analyzed with the presented approach to demonstrate the probabilistic prediction of the bearing capacity of piles by considering the spatial correlation of the CPT data.

The purpose of this paper is to reduce the microcontroller's average consumption of a wireless sensor node through architectural and design processes using advanced technologies. This paper provides a state-of-the-art investigation on the most up-to date Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) techniques. A benchmark is given to choose the appropriate DVFS technique according to the type of component, the time and resources constraints, the application requirements, the expected performance level, etc. An energy-saving design is implemented using an ultra-low power microcontroller MSP430 and is based on the DVFS strategy. To efficiently quantify the consumed energy and to ensure more accuracy, a new concept is introduced, which is the normalized power to offer more accuracy. Real voltage/frequency scaling measurement were conducted. We show that a high voltage/frequency can lead to up to 57\% increase of the normalized-power.},

This actual response is then compared to the spatial average response (the response of a homogeneous clay whose undrained shear strength is equal to certain spatial average). It is observed that the actual response can be well approximated by the spatial average response only for situations where the critical slip curve is constrained.

All data are assumed to be multivariate, uncertain, unique, sparse, and incomplete (MUSIC). A similarity measure is proposed, and the effectiveness of the proposed similarity measure is illustrated by considering a specific clay database and a specific site in Norway that is outside the database. The records are weighted by their similarity measures and combined with the limited site-specific data to construct a quasi-site-specific transformation model based on a more restricted and more relevant coverage of geotechnical characteristics relevant to the site.},

  abstract = {During the last two decades, increasing use of full-coverage sonic mapping of the seafloor has made us more aware of the large and different number of seafloor processes and events bearing significant geohazard potential. This awareness combines with the increasing use of the seafloor for infrastructure and with the high density of population and settlement on the coast. Seafloor mapping is the first step in making a census of the geohazard-bearing features present in a given offshore area. It often provides the only tool for a comprehensive, although non-specific, seafloor geohazard assessment over large areas that are scarcely groundtruthed by acoustic prospection and seafloor sampling. However, the characterization of geohazard features on a morphological basis alone is limited, and more detailed investigations are needed to define the character and state of activity of potentially hazardous features. Such investigations include the use of deep-tow or autonomous platforms designed to acquire high-resolution data at depth as well as in situ measurements, both being very expensive activities not applicable over large areas. Thus seafloor mapping is often not only the first and the main but also the only tool for a comprehensive seafloor geohazard assessment.},

The devices considered are a free-fall cone penetrometer (FFcP) and an instrumented free-fall sphere (IFFS). The performance of the FFPs in assessing soil undrained shear strength was investigated and compared through field trials in the soft sediments of the Swan River, Perth, Western Australia. The penetrometers achieved impact velocities of 1.4--5.8~m/s from drop heights of 0.7--3.0~m above the riverbed, and embedded to depths of up to 1.6 times the FFP length (1.45~m) and 4.5 times the IFFS diameter (0.89~m). The FFP data provided the shear strength indirectly using the acceleration measured from an onboard inertial measurement unit. The accuracy depends on the assumptions made regarding the magnitude of dynamic bearing and shaft frictional resistance. Uncertainty associated with dynamic bearing resistance causes a {\textpm}10\% and {\textpm}13\% variation in the calculated strength for the IFFS and the FFcP, respectively. However, the equivalent uncertainty in dynamic shaft resistance can cause a variation in the calculated strength of up to {\textpm}76\% for the FFcP. The FFcP has higher embedment potential than the IFFS, but the IFFS has the advantage of a simpler interpretation without needing to account for dynamic shaft resistance.},

The speed and ease of deployment relative to conventional `push-in' penetrometers is attractive, with the trade-off of more complex interpretation. This paper considers two approaches for deducing the undrained shear strength from a slender conical tipped penetrometer. The first requires as input only the vertical acceleration of the penetrometer, where the soil strength is determined indirectly by considering the various forces acting on the penetrometer and solving the equation of motion. The second determines the undrained shear strength more directly by combining tip load cell and u2 pore pressure measurements. In both cases, adjustments for drag resistance and strain-rate effects are necessary to deduce a strength compatible with that determined from the equivalent push-in penetrometer test. Application of both methods to a series of centrifuge tests in normally consolidated kaolin clay reveals that the direct method -- using the tip load cell and u2 pore pressure measurements -- is much more reliable and can produce strength profiles that are within 10\% of those obtained from push-in piezocone tests, compared with variations of up to 75\% for the indirect accelerometer based method, which requires additional assumptions. The centrifuge study also provides direct quantification of the strain rate enhancement of tip and shaft resistance, revealing much higher strain rate dependency for shaft resistance than is typically allowed for.},

  abstract = {The piezoball, a ball penetrometer featuring pore pressure measurements, is a relatively new device that is potentially superior to the more commonly used piezocone for profiling fine-grained soils. This is due to lower uncertainty in how to derive soil strength from the net penetration resistance and the option of measuring consolidation characteristics during pauses in the penetration, potentially more quickly than in a piezocone test. This paper presents results from a series of piezoball tests undertaken at a soft clay test site using a piezoball that measures pore pressure concurrently at the ball equator, tip and half-way between the tip and equator, the so-called mid-face position. Analysis of the test data provides strong arguments for measuring pore pressure at both the equator and mid-face positions. The coefficient of consolidation derived from piezoball dissipation data using recently developed numerical solutions is shown to be highly comparable to that deduced from a piezocone dissipation test. This paper shows that the penetration resistance varies significantly with the rate of penetration due to either viscous rate effects or increasing degrees of partial consolidation during penetration, both of which influence the estimation of undrained shear strength and hamper interpretation of dissipation data. Guidance on assessing the drainage response during a piezoball penetration test is provided. Finally, dissipation test data presented in the paper are added to a database formed from centrifuge and field tests that is used to form a new empirical method for estimating the coefficient of consolidation.},

  abstract = {The overall aim of this paper is to contribute to a better understanding of the Digital Twin (DT) paradigm in the built environment by drawing inspiration from existing DT research in manufacturing. The DT is a Product Life Management information construct that has migrated to the built environment while research on the subject has grown intensely in recent years. Common to early research phases, DT research in the built environment has developed organically, setting the basis for mature definitions and robust research frameworks. As DT research in manufacturing is the most developed, this paper seeks to advance the understanding of DTs in the built environment by analysing how the DT systems reported in manufacturing literature are structured and how they function. Firstly, this paper presents a thorough review and a comparison of DT, cyber-physical systems (CPS), and building information modelling (BIM). Then, the results of the review and categorisation of DT structural and functional descriptions are presented. Fifty-four academic publications and industry reports were reviewed, and their structural and functional descriptions were analysed in detail. Three types of structural models (i.e. conceptual models, system architectures, and data models) and three types of functional models (process and communication models) were identified. DT maturity models were reviewed as well. From the reviewed descriptions, four categories of DT conceptual models (prototypical, model-based, interface-oriented, and service-based) and six categories of DT process models (DT creation, DT synchronisation, asset monitoring, prognosis and simulation, optimal operations, and optimised design) were defined and its applicability to the AECO assessed. While model-based and service-based models are the most applicable to the built environment, amendments are still required. Prognosis and simulation process models are the most widely applicable for AECO use-cases. The main contribution to knowledge of this study is that it compiles the DT's structural and functional descriptions used in manufacturing and it provides the basis to develop DT conceptual and process models specific to requirements of the built environment sectors.},

  abstract = {The penetration rate effect on the strength of clay and sand was studied by constant velocity penetration tests performed with various velocities up to 2.662{\enspace}f.p.s. (81.14{\enspace}cm/s). The clay and sand targets were of various strengths and moisture contents. The construction of the penetrometer is similar to that used in static tests, and in each test the cone resistance, sleeve friction, and penetration velocity were recorded.Experimental results indicated that for granular soils the effects of penetration velocity on cone and sleeve friction resistances are insignificant, whereas, for cohesive soils, the increase in penetration velocity causes an increase in the cone and friction resistances. It is found that for the cohesive soils the ratio of dynamic to static strength is directly proportional to the logarithm of the penetration velocity ratio. The proportionality constant of this relationship defined as soil viscosity coefficient depends on the physical properties of the soil and the soil strength and its value increases as the strength of the soil decreases. For the tested soils various values of the soil viscosity coefficient are proposed for different strength ranges. The validity of the analytical relationship is established for penetration velocities ranging from 0.0044{\enspace}f.p.s. (0.13{\enspace}cm/s) to 18{\enspace}f.p.s. (550{\enspace}cm/s).}

  abstract = {A wide variety of cone penetration test (CPT) based methods of estimating pile base capacity exist. These methods typically link the base resistance at some specified pile base settlement level to a representative value of cone resistance qc through a correlation factor to account for pile installation effects. The representative or design qc value is derived using procedures which typically average the cone resistance over a number of pile diameters above and below the pile tip. As the averaging procedure varies from region to region attempts to unify design methods are hampered by uncertainties related to the design value that should be adopted. In this paper two series of laboratory CPT tests on layered soil deposits are used to calibrate an alternative CPT averaging procedure that, when compared to existing procedures, can adequately capture the transition in qc across a variety of soil conditions.},

  abstract = {During its maximum extension, the Saalian ice cap reached into the central Netherlands, where glacier tongues excavated over 100 m deep basins in the unconsolidated Middle and Early Pleistocene sediments. The basins are filled by relatively thick successions of Late Saalian, Eemian and Weichselian sediments. The fill of the Amsterdam glacial basin is among the best known and studied in the Netherlands. The Late Saalian sediments consist mainly of warves and ill-bedded clays and silts with, along its southern margin, influxes of sands from the surrounding ice-pushed ridges. During deposition of these sediments, the Amsterdam basin formed part of a large lake extending into the present North Sea. Draining of this lake at the end of the Late Saalian left small, shallow pools at the site of the glacial basins.Late Saalian and Eemian sediments are probably separated by a short break, although sedimentation may have been continuous in the deepest part of the basin. The Eemian deposits consist in main lines of a thin, diatom-rich sapropel at the base, overlain by an up to 30 m thick clay-rich sequence covered by a wedge of sand that measures more than 20 m in the northern part of the basin and that peters out southwards. As appears from the fauna, most of the clays were deposited in a lagoonal setting shielded behind a threshold and/or barrier. The rate of sediment supply was low so that lagoonal conditions were maintained over a long timespan. Sands derived from the surrounding ice-pushed ridges and transported by longshore drift and tidal currents formed a spit at the northern margin of the basin, which moved southward after eustatic sea-level rise stabilized and the lagoon was filled by clay. Loading of this clay-rich sequence by the spit and its washover fans induced subsidence, however, because of compaction, so that marine conditions were maintained until after the Eemian highstand. Fluvial and eolian sediments of Weichselian age, locally reaching a thickness of almost 10 m, eventually levelled the Amsterdam glacial basin.},

Using soil property statistics derived from the results of laboratory and cone penetration test (CPT) data for the different soil layers at the site, the dyke was analysed for the initial (i.e. operating) conditions, as well as for the later stage of the test leading up to failure. The computed probabilities of failure and back-figured factors of safety were consistent with the point at which failure occurred in the test, as was the range of possible failure mechanisms. The uncertainty in the stability assessment was reduced by considering the spatial nature of the soil variability, and by conditioning analyses to CPT measurement data. It is shown that the reliability-based approach enables more informed stability assessments that could make the difference between a dyke being assessed as safe or requiring costly improvement.},

  abstract = {Buildings are one of the largest consumers of energy and materials, and hence they are also one of the largest contributors to negative environmental impacts. Traditionally, energy consumed by buildings during their operation phase was the most significant in their lifecycles and far exceeded the embodied energy. However, in contemporary low-energy buildings, the embodied energy is proportionally higher because of the prevalent use of energy-intensive materials. To determine the embodied energy and environmental impacts of building materials, the Dutch have developed an assessment method, which has also been adapted by BREEAM-NL. This paper offers an overview of the Dutch approach for assessing the environmental impacts of building materials and demonstrates its practical application. The use of the Dutch Assessment Method to identify, and quantify materials-related design improvements has been demonstrated through an exemplifying case study. It has been identified that the environmental impact of a building is largely influenced by the material choices made at the early design stage of the project.},

For multi-layer systems, it is expected that the cone resistance would be influenced by the layer thickness (relative to the cone diameter), the number of layers within the zone of influence and the characteristic cone resistances of the individual layers. The Dutch method for determination of the pile base resistance can be used to simulate the cone resistance in thinly inter-layered soils and to come up with correction factors as function of the aspects mentioned above. A test program (parametric study) is defined in order to validate the proposed modified Dutch method. The proposed simulation method fits reasonably well with the interim test results.},

  abstract = {The design of new and assessment of existing quay walls is subject to large uncertainties. Dealing with these uncertainties is a crucial part of the engineering process. The way uncertainties are addressed has a large impact on construction and maintenance costs and on the reliability ultimately obtained. Especially in the assessment of existing structures the uncertainties can be large. An existing structure allows us to use actual performance information in the assessment, such as the structural response to loading. One way to obtain the structural response is test loading assisted by monitoring. In this research Bayesian updating is used to reduce uncertainties and to more effectively use the obtained measurement data. We present a case study of an existing quay structure along with fictitious measurement data to demonstrate the potential effects of test loading on the reliability of the structure. The results show that Bayesian updating successfully reduces the uncertainty (i.e. standard deviation) of the model prediction. Using monitoring data and Bayesian updating provides a more realistic model of the capacity of the existing quay structure and thus a more accurate reliability assessment. Which may lead to extension of the structure's lifetime or that higher loads can be accepted.},

We review their origin, main geochemical weathering reactions, and influence on the natural geogenic environment. These materials have properties that set them apart from the geogenic materials that they replace and overlie. They are formed under high-temperature conditions, are thermodynamically unstable, and may exhibit physical and chemical changes on relatively short timescales, an aspect relatively new for mapping geologists. Because knowledge of deposits in the shallow urban subsurface is increasingly important for urban planning, more articulation and detail in the classification of novel anthropogenic materials is necessary.},

The measured unit shaft friction and base resistance of the database piles are compared with values calculated using well known methods that correlate capacity directly to the cone penetration test (CPT) end resistance. It is shown that the updated Laboratoire Central des Ponts et Chauss{\'e}es (LCPC) method in 2012 is the best performing of existing CPT-based methods. A new CPT approach is proposed that, similar to other recently published approaches and experimental studies, involves the soil behavior type index (IcIc{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}mrow{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}I{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi{$>$}c{$<$}/mi{$><$}/msub{$><$}/mrow{$><$}/math{$>$}) determined in CPTs in the formulation. This approach can be expected to lead to more reliable estimates of pile capacity as it provides an improved fit to the new database while also being consistent with the trends implicit in the LCPC method, which is based on a larger and independent data set.},

This paper presents a field trial to assess the feasibility of using FBG sensor arrays to measure strain in driven steel piles. Two FBG arrays were installed in grooves within the wall of an open-ended steel pile such that the finished profile was completely flush with the pile shaft. The pile was then driven into a dense sand deposit using an impact hammer to provide the required installation energy. The FBG gauges were monitored throughout driving in conjunction with accelerometers to quantify the scale of the hammer impacts. The FBG sensors were subjected to hammer blows that yielded pile accelerations between 500\,g and 1400\,g during installation. The fibre optic sensors were measured throughout driving, where they were observed to respond to the hammer impacts, showing a rapid increase in strain and a return to their initial values between hammer strikes. After installation, a lateral load test was performed with independent load measuring devices. Excellent agreement was observed between the measured moments and those inferred from the FBG strain output. The output of this trial demonstrates that FBG strain sensors are a viable means of measuring load transfer in foundation systems and are suitably robust to withstand high pile driving accelerations.},

The embankment, which had a long-term history of stability problems, was studied using a combination of ground-penetrating radar (GPR), electrical resistivity tomography (ERT), multichannel analysis of surface waves (MASW) and geotechnical testing. A significant thickening of the ballast layer around the failure location was observed using GPR, which confirmed the existence of an ongoing stability problem in the area. ERT profiles determined the presence and spatial extent of a significant layer of soft clay both beneath and to the east of the embankment, which could have a major impact on its long-term stability. ERT also detected steeply sloping bedrock close to the failure zone that is likely to have contributed to the long-term settlement of the embankment, which necessitated frequent re-ballasting. MASW confirmed the presence of the steeply sloping bedrock in addition to determining the low stiffness (Gmax) values of the embankment fill. High quality sampling of the soft clay deposit was undertaken and strength and compressibility tests revealed the importance of this layer to both the on-going serviceability problems evident for the original embankment and the stability problems encountered by the remodelled section.},

  abstract = {As offshore pile foundations increase in diameter and weight, the risk of uncontrolled and unsafe penetration events (pile run) also increases. Traditional approaches to evaluating this risk rely on static resistance to driving (SRD) formulations, equating the SRD to the effective weight of the pile. However, high penetration speeds during uncontrolled pile penetration can lead to a soil response much different to static conditions, particularly with regards to pore pressure dissipation around the pile. With this in mind, the paper proposes an analytical model for determining when uncontrolled penetration may occur and its extent. The model integrates novel SRD formulations with a penetration rate effect model, both of which are derived from cone penetration test (CPT) measurements. The model's predictions were then benchmarked against industry-standard methods using a database of self-weight penetration events in clays and sands of varying densities and strengths. The predicted self-weight penetrations compared well with field observations across the full range of soil conditions and gave a better performance compared to standard prediction methods. Furthermore, the results emphasise the critical role of soil volumetric behaviour during shearing and future research should clarify the influence of rapid penetration on the pile's shaft and base resistance.},

The piles were founded in dense to very dense river-deposited sands, a soil that is widespread across the Dutch North Sea sector. The deposit is characterised by cone penetration test (CPT) tip resistances of up to 90 MPa and offers a detailed insight into pile response in realistic offshore conditions. Each test pile was incrementally loaded to failure under compression, while fibre optic sensors measured the changing deformation of the pile. The analysis and interpretation of the load test data focussed on how the three slender piles behaved at large shaft and base resistances. Notably, the piles mobilised base and shaft resistances greater than currently prescribed limiting resistances in design standards, thereby highlighting some overconservatism present when designing piles in dense sand.},

  abstract = {Driven pipe piles are used extensively in coastal and offshore projects. Traditionally piles with diameters of 2--3~m were common in the offshore wind industry, however the diameter of monopiles to support a 10~MW wind turbine is more commonly 10~m. Offshore wind projects are being developed at sites with very low seabed strengths and pipe pile weights are increasing significantly. Self-weight penetration occurs when the pile is first placed on the seabed. A combination of low strength seabed conditions and increased pile self-weight leads to the risk of pile run (uncontrolled self-weight penetration) during installation at some sites. Predicting pile run risk, run velocities and penetration depths is challenging due to inherent rate effects and the large strains involved. While rapid penetration processes can be considered using both analytic methods and Large Deformation Finite Element simulations, the role of soil rigidity is seldom taken into account, despite known implications from static pile assessments. This study uses large deformation simulation with the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian method to simulate the pile running process for five well-studied fine-grained soils with varying elastic stiffnesses. Results are compared with analytic methods, highlighting the limitations of current predictive techniques in terms of both the end tip and shaft resistance. As a corollary, a linear trend for the final penetration depth with respect to the logarithm of the soil rigidity index is incorporated in an existing analytic code based on results obtained from large deformation simulations.},

However, more complex probabilistic approaches are increasing in application in order to provide a more uniform level of reliability, thus reducing the cost of the investment or the risk, or both. Also, in terms of tools and methods for performing the calculations, the Finite Element Method (FEM) is very popular nowadays due accessible computers power and user-friendly specialized software which can provide more realistic model, with affordable calculation effort. The present paper presents a case study of applied full probabilistic analysis of a retaining wall for real project deep excavation in Bucharest city, Romania, by FEM calculation in Plaxis 2D software coupled with Probabilistic Toolkit (PTK) software for reliability calculation. The limit function is set on a target value for the displacements of the retaining wall to allow to design for the SLS, since this is in many cases the governing state for deep excavations in urban areas. Different probability distributions are used for assessing the statistics of the geotechnical parameters and the reliability results obtained through these are discussed. Also, a discussion is made on the necessity of including more specific target reliability values for SLS verification and especially for temporary structures in the design codes.},

  abstract = {Inherent inhomogeneity of geomaterials highlights the significance of geotechnical investigations in practice for almost every project. Geotechnical engineers work interactively with geologists and other branches of engineering during investigation, design, and construction phases of projects. Geotechnical investigation is the procedure of acquiring information on subsurface soil condition and synthesizing them in order to determine geomaterial parameters required for design. In addition to initial literature review, site reconnaissance, site visits, and subsurface exploration, there are five other general categories for sources of acquiring data: geophysical testing, elementary laboratory testing, physical modeling, instrumentation and monitoring, as well as in~situ tests. The extent of investigations must be within the zone influenced by the structures to be constructed on the ground, which can be estimated by the recommendations provided in codes and manuals. Nondestructive geophysical tests rapidly provide 3D information of the site with no disturbance, while, elementary laboratory testing helps acquiring a broad range of data regarding the soil's physical, strength, and stiffness properties. However, they involve limitations such as sampling scale and boundary conditions. By means of physical modeling, medium-scale tests can be performed with simulating actual field conditions. Instrumentation and monitoring allows designers to observe and record the behavior of soil and structures during construction and lifetime functioning which can significantly lead to controlling operation procedure, reducing cost and safety factors along with increasing safety. In situ penetration tests are employed as a complementary tool to laboratory testing and are considered to be a fast, accurate, and economical source for collecting data. Subsequent to performing geotechnical investigations, the obtained data along with their interpretation and synthesis are presented in the form of geotechnical site investigation reports and geotechnical design reports. Despite all progresses made in the realm of acquiring data, the interpretations and design procedures have always been guided by engineering judgment.},

However, the application to large spatial databases rises the following requirements for clustering algorithms: minimal requirements of domain knowledge to determine the input parameters, discovery of clusters with arbitrary shape and good efficiency on large databases. The well-known clustering algorithms offer no solution to the combination of these requirements. In this paper, we present the new clustering algorithm DBSCAN relying on a density-based notion of clusters which is designed to discover clusters of arbitrary shape. DBSCAN requires only one input parameter and supports the user in determining an appropriate value for it. We performed an experimental evaluation of the effectiveness and efficiency of DBSCAN using synthetic data and real data of the SEQUOIA 2000 benchmark. The results of our experiments demonstrate that (1) DBSCAN is significantly more effective in discovering clusters of arbitrary shape than the well-known algorithm CLAR-ANS, and that (2) DBSCAN outperforms CLARANS by a factor of more than 100 in terms of efficiency.},

  abstract = {Reflecting the historic first European seismic code, this professional book focuses on seismic design, assessment and retrofitting of concrete buildings, with thorough reference to, and application of, EN-Eurocode 8. Following the publication of EN-Eurocode 8 in 2004-05, 30 countries are now introducing this European standard for seismic design, for application in parallel with existing national standards (till March 2010) and exclusively after that. Eurocode 8 is also expected to influence standards in countries outside Europe, or at the least, to be applied there for important facilities. Owing to the increasing awareness of the threat posed by existing buildings substandard and deficient buildings and the lack of national or international standards for assessment and retrofitting, its impact in that field is expected to be major. Written by the lead person in the development of the EN-Eurocode 8, the present handbook explains the principles and rationale of seismic design according to modern codes and provides thorough guidance for the conceptual seismic design of concrete buildings and their foundations. It examines the experimental behaviour of concrete members under cyclic loading and modelling for design and analysis purposes; it develops the essentials of linear or nonlinear seismic analysis for the purposes of design, assessment and retrofitting (especially using Eurocode 8); and gives detailed guidance for modelling concrete buildings at the member and at the system level. Moreover, readers gain access to overviews of provisions of Eurocode 8, plus an understanding for them on the basis of the simple models of the element behaviour presented in the book. Also examined are the modern trends in performance- and displacement-based seismic assessment of existing buildings, comparing the relevant provisions of Eurocode 8 with those of new US prestandards, and details of the most common and popular seismic retrofitting techniques for concrete buildings and guidance for retrofitting strategies at the system level. Comprehensive walk-through examples of detailed design elucidate the application of Eurocode 8 to common situations in practical design. Examples and case studies of seismic assessment and retrofitting of a few real buildings are also presented. From the reviews:"This is a massive book that has no equal in the published literature, as far as the reviewer knows. It is dense and comprehensive and leaves nothing to chance. It is certainly taxing on the reader and the potential user, but without it, use of Eurocode 8 will be that much more difficult. In short, this is a must-read book for researchers and practitioners in Europe, and of use to readers outside of Europe too. This book will remain an indispensable backup to Eurocode 8 and its existing Designers' Guide to EN 1998-1 and EN 1998-5 (published in 2005), for many years to come. Congratulations to the author for a very well planned scope and contents, and for a flawless execution of the plan". AMR S. ELNASHAI "The book is an impressive source of information to understand the response of reinforced concrete buildings under seismic loads with the ultimate goal of presenting and explaining the state of the art of seismic design. Underlying the contents of the book is the in-depth knowledge of the author in this field and in particular his extremely important contribution to the development of the European Design Standard EN 1998 - Eurocode 8: Design of structures for earthquake resistance. However, although Eurocode 8 is at the core of the book, many comparisons are made to other design practices, namely from the US and from Japan, thus enriching the contents and interest of the book".

Despite the common belief that the log transformation can decrease the variability of data and make data conform more closely to the normal distribution, this is usually not the case. Moreover, the results of standard statistical tests performed on log-transformed data are often not relevant for the original, non-transformed data.We demonstrate these problems by presenting examples that use simulated data. We conclude that if used at all, data transformations must be applied very cautiously. We recommend that in most circumstances researchers abandon these traditional methods of dealing with skewed data and, instead, use newer analytic methods that are not dependent on the distribution the data, such as generalized estimating equations (GEE).},

  abstract = {Investigating the interaction between flow intensity and a ship propeller jet scouring process is paramount to predict scour dimensions in mooring sites in navigation channels, for instance. While the condition of still water is typical in protected mooring sites, in other real-world conditions, like docking in waterways, the presence of an additional flow approaching a rotating propeller can induce changes in the propeller jet hydrodynamics and in turn in the scouring process. Note that, although ship-hull and rudders influence the jet propagation and the flow field, the present research project aimed at studying the propeller-inducing effects only. Literature studies that have relied on this assumption are rarely found, with only a few examining the impact of the intensity of the flow on the propeller jet scour. This study presents an experimental campaign aimed at assessing the effects of flow intensity on propeller jets in confined conditions. Specifically, three different flow intensities and three propeller distances from a vertical quay-wall were tested. The findings are presented through profiles of the scoured bed, and bathymetries at the equilibrium condition and empirical formulas for calculating the principal dimensions of the scour holes are given. To explore the intricate hydrodynamics and understand how the intensity of the flow affects the scour hole development, and to investigate boundary effects on the flow field, we performed Reynolds-Averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) simulations. These simulations were applied to the three-dimensional scoured bathymetry in a state of equilibrium. The satisfactory match between numerical results and sampled velocities at the equilibrium stage ensures the reliability of the simulations. To the authors' knowledge, these configurations had not been previously simulated, owing to the complexities involved in computing a moving mesh in presence of a bathymetry and a confining vertical wall. The results offer the first numerical demonstration of boundary effects on the characteristics of propeller jets both in the presence and in the absence of an additional channel flow.},

During the installation of Drilled Displacement Piles (DDPs), measurements include penetration speed (vz), rotational speed (vr), downward thrust, torque (T) or hydraulic pressure (Pdrill). With these measurements in mind, data from 32 DDPs across 10 project sites in the US and Europe were collected and analyzed. A generalized formulation for installation effort was developed to compare existing pile databases with the data gathered by the authors. The proposed method uses a decomposed installation effort model that separately accounts for the shaft and toe portions of the pile. A regression analysis of the dataset shows the potential of using installation effort to predict pile capacity and provides fundamental knowledge towards establishing a basic framework for estimating pile load capacities during DDP installation. This application highlights the value of real-time monitoring data in performance-based foundation design.},

  abstract = {Drilled Displacement Piles (DDP) provide an ideal foundation solution that combines the benefits of ground improvement with traditional advantages of piling systems. This paper offers insights gathered from 55 construction projects in which nearly 130 DDPs were installed and tested axially. High quality site exploration data (e.g., Cone Penetration Test (CPT) and Standard Penetration Test (SPT)) were evaluated to derive geotechnical analysis parameters. The test sites consisted of mostly mixed soil types with strongly stratified layers of sand, silt, and clay. Pile diameters ranged between 35 and 61 cm (14 to 24 inches). Prior to analyzing the axial performance of DDPs, a variety of failure interpretation methods were assessed to confidently extrapolate failure loads when field testing was terminated prior to pile failure. Results of this study suggested the Van der Veen's (1953) method to most closely estimate the load that triggers pile plunging behavior specific to DDPs, followed by the Butler \& Hoy (1977) and L1-L2 methods (Hirany and Kulhawy, 1989). Hereafter, in-situ axial load test results were compared with a wide range of analytical methods, including those developed specifically for DDPs. Predictive accuracy was assessed in terms of total pile capacity and pile settlement and separated based on pile diameter, stiffness, and soil type. Most examined analytical methods underpredict the in-situ pile capacities for both, CPT and SPT -based analysis. It was also found that the difference between the experimentally determined and predicted capacities is related to the level of improvement in the surrounding soil following pile installation. A general comparison between predictive axial accuracy and the observed level of ground improvement is also discussed for sandy and mixed type of soils.},

  abstract = {A method is presented for the analysis and prediction of single pile behaviour under maintained loading, based on the use of hyperbolic functions to describe individual shaft and base performance. When these functions are combined, and elastic pile shortening is added by a relatively simple procedure, an accurate model is obtained. By a simple method of linkage, which relies on the fact that a hyperbolic function of the type described requires only definition of its origin, its asymptote and either its initial slope or a single point on the function, conventional 'elastic' soil parameters and ultimate loads may be used to describe total performance. By means of the changing slope of such functions, this method also reflects well in the increase of soil moduli at low strains. Examples are given from back-analysis of some fully instrumented and other cast-in-place pile test results, to demonstrate that good agreement with all recorded features can be achieved using the model. Extensive use has confirmed its validity for maintained load tests in a wide range of soils. Provided that piles have been made to settle sufficiently under load, so that the latter part of each relationship is well defined beyond the stage where shaft friction is close to a constant value, all the main relevant parameters can be determined with good accuracy in back-analysis. The derived data may then be used to predict behaviour of piles in similar circumstances on other sites or of piles of different diameter in the same soils. Subject to the conditions described in the Paper, the method has far-reaching implications for design, construction and testing techniques.

  abstract = {Databases used in developing cone penetration test (CPT)-based design methods for driven piles have been dominated by data for the preformed variant, with the driven cast-in-situ (DCIS) pile category poorly represented. A database of 30 DCIS piles was used to appraise the ability of seven established CPT-based methods for driven piles to predict the total capacity of DCIS piles in granular soil. A subset of instrumented piles within the database was used to appraise the ability of these methods to predict shaft and base resistances separately. In general, the UWA-05 method provided the most reliable predictions for total and base capacity, whereas the LCPC-82 method is recommended for prediction of shaft resistance using shaft coefficients for standard driven piles. The paper collated findings from the recent instrumented pile tests conducted by National University of Ireland (NUI) Galway examining the mechanisms of shaft resistance in DCIS piles. In spite of uncertainties regarding mechanisms affecting the shaft resistance of DCIS piles during installation, the data from the instrumented tests presented herein provide strong evidence that the shaft resistance of a DCIS pile in sand is comparable to that of a preformed displacement pile. The NUI Galway pile tests also showed that the normalized base resistances for preformed and DCIS piles are equivalent.},

Established and emerging trends in ICP testing are captured through a database of over 100 published case histories from the literature.

However, there are relatively few case histories of load tests on DCIS piles in the literature to verify the assumption that they behave as large displacement piles. In particular, the shaft resistance of DCIS piles in sand is uncertain due to the complex interaction between the freshly cast concrete and surrounding displaced soil after extraction of the steel installation tube. This paper describes the installation, curing, and maintained compression load testing of three temporary-cased DCIS test piles at a uniform sand site near Coventry, United Kingdom. The piles were instrumented with vibrating wire strain gauges to enable accurate measurement of the local shear stress generated on the pile shaft during maintained compression loading. The tests showed that the peak average and local shear stresses tended to mobilize at greater shaft displacements than traditional preformed displacement piles during loading. A clear reduction in normalized local shear stresses (and hence radial effective stress) at failure with distance from the pile base, i.e., friction fatigue, was evident for all piles, implying that radial stresses generated during driven installation of the steel tube are not erased upon concreting and tube withdrawal. Furthermore, the inferred normalized radial effective stresses at failure were remarkably similar to those reported for traditional preformed displacement piles in the literature.},

Data concerning low back pain can be of categorical nature, in the form of a check-list in which each item denotes presence or absence of a clinical condition. Latent class analysis is a model-based clustering method for multivariate categorical responses, which can be applied to such data for a preliminary diagnosis of the type of pain. In this work, we propose a variable selection method for latent class analysis applied to the selection of the most useful variables in detecting the group structure in the data. The method is based on the comparison of two different models and allows the discarding of those variables with no group information and those variables carrying the same information as the already selected ones. We consider a swap-stepwise algorithm where at each step the models are compared through an approximation to their Bayes factor. The method is applied to the selection of the clinical criteria most useful for the clustering of patients in different classes. It is shown to perform a parsimonious variable selection and to give a clustering performance comparable to the expert-based classification of patients into three classes of pain.},

Special enhancements are derived for the particular case where the individual additive components are regression trees, and tools for interpreting such "TreeBoost" models are presented. Gradient boosting of regression trees produces competitive, highly robust, interpretable procedures for both regression and classification, especially appropriate for mining less than clean data.

  abstract = {Spatial 3D formation drillability distribution is crucial for the drilling trajectory planning, collision detection, and drilling optimization in the natural gas and petroleum fields. Conventional geostatistical methods are usually used to establish the 3D formation drillability field model. However, few or no machine learning methods, which have a powerful fitting capability, are used to build that model. This paper proposes a new modeling framework for establishing the spatial 3D formation drillability model. Four methods, one geostatistical (Kriging), one non-stochastic (ScatteredInterpolant), and two machine learning methods (random forest and support vector regression) are analyzed in this modeling framework. Well logging data such as acoustic and formation density are introduced as the input parameters. Moreover, the mutual information analysis is introduced to measure the correlations between the 3D coordinates and formation drillability. Finally, comparisons are explored in the 10-fold cross-validation, 3D modeling, and final test experiments using data from Xujiaweizi area, Northeast China. The results indicate that SI has the best 10-fold cross-validation performance while RF achieves the best prediction accuracy in the final test among the four compared methods. The proposed new modeling framework for 3D formation drillability model provides a platform and is applicable to other modeling methods and data.},

One series of tests involved the installation and load testing of steel open- and closed-ended piles in loose sand contained in a large pile testing chamber. A second series involved tests on open- and closed-ended steel piles and a concrete bored pile at a dense sand test bed site. The experiments were designed to investigate the effects of pile type, sand consistency, and installation resistance on a pile's base response during static loading. The tests revealed that both the base capacity and stiffness of piles in sand are controlled by the degree of prestress imposed on the soil below the pile tip. Simple expressions, which require the small strain stiffness and cone penetration test data as the input parameters, are developed to predict the base pressure~-- settlement response. The final part of the paper employs other field tests on full-scale displacement piles and bored piles to verify the validity of the proposed approach.}

By comparing the load test results with in situ test results from cone penetration tests, correlations between the end bearing pressure mobilised at normalised settlement levels of 10\% of the footing width and the cone penetration test qc value were studied. For the maintained load tests, these correlations were found to be similar to those used in routine design practice. When creep effects were reduced using constant rate of penetration load testing, the end bearing pressure mobilised was significantly higher than that assumed in normal practice, and it was in keeping with the results of finite-element analyses performed using a soil model that ignored creep. In the final section, the field test results are compared to database pile load tests performed on non-displacement piles in sand.},

Four instrumented model piles were installed at a dense sand test-bed site. The test series was designed to impose different levels of cyclic loading during pile installation. Static and cyclic load tests were subsequently performed to study the differences in the axial capacities developed for ostensibly monotonic and cyclic installations. The test results indicated that the mobilized horizontal effective stress regime that controls pile side friction primarily depends on the in situ sand state, as reflected by the cone penetration test (CPT) qcqc{$<$}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{$><$}msub{$><$}mi{$>$}q{$<$}/mi{$><$}mi{$>$}c{$<$}/mi{$><$}/msub{$><$}/math{$>$} resistance. A zone of highly stressed sand that produced a concentration of high shear resistance was mobilized in the vicinity of the pile base. The horizontal effective stress that acted on the pile shaft reduced in response to cyclic loading, with the largest reductions occurring for high-intensity cyclic loading or when the pile had experienced only a few load cycles during installation. Although cyclic loading caused a reduction in the horizontal effective stress that acted on the pile shaft, the elevated stress built up in the vicinity of the pile base during installation remained higher than that remote from the base. The elevated stress in the vicinity of the pile base only dissipated after cyclic tension loading had been applied.},

Due to the population density exploitation of underground space is vital for commercial developments and transport networks. Piles are used as primary support elements in deep excavations, cut and cover tunnels, quay walls, flood defences and to provide uplift resistance to the base of tunnels and basements. This paper examines empirical correlations linking the Cone Penetration Test (CPT) end resistance qc and the resistance of deep foundations in sand. It is found that correlations between qc and pile end resistance are independent of pile diameter. However, the impact of installation method, residual load, plugging and sand creep should be considered. In the case of shaft resistance, constant correlation factors between qc and average shaft resistance are possible for non-displacement piles. For the case of displacement piles, correlations that include the effects of friction fatigue and pile plugging during installation are recommended.},

Groups of crucial dimensionless problem parameters related to the soil profile and the foundation geometry are identified and their effects on the response are studied. Results are presented in the form of simple formulae and dimensionless graphs for both the static and dynamic parts of impedances, pertaining to surface and embedded foundations having circular, strip, rectangular or arbitrary plan shape and supported by three types of idealized soil profiles: the halfspace, the stratum-over-bedrock and the layer-over-halfspace. Consideration is given to the effects of inhomogeneity, anisotropy and non-linearity of soil. The various results are synthesized in a case study referring to the response of two rigid massive foundations, and practical recommendations are made on how to inexpensively predict the response of foundations supported by actual soil deposits.},

The largest containership size has evolved from about 5500 TEU in 1995 to more than 23,000 TEU in 2019. The economic rationale for further scale increases in ship size is largely dependent on the current and future market conditions in the container shipping market, the adaptive capacity of ports and terminals (both economically and technologically) and, more recently, environmental requirements and considerations. This paper evaluates under which economic, operational and environmental conditions and expectations, shipping companies are likely to push the ultra-large containership (ULCS) size from 18,000 to 20,000 TEU to 25,000 TEU. Differences in both annual container slot cost and more comprehensive cost--benefit measures are assessed under different key market-based and operational conditions. The basic cost parameters for 20,000 TEU and 25,000 TEU vessels were estimated using a regression analysis applied to actual data of vessels up to 18,000 TEU. Our findings show that a further scale increase to a 25,000 TEU ULCS still generates economies of scale. However, very low freight rates, i.e. even below the poor freight rates of 2016--2017, and low load factors would not be conducive to the economic viability of 25,000 TEU ships, compared to smaller ULCSs. This study complements and updates the findings of previous studies (which focused on much smaller ship sizes) and contributes to the ongoing academic and corporate discussion on drivers and impediments of scale increases in vessel size by explicitly incorporating time- and context-dependent factors affecting optimal ship size.},

It has been successfully tested in different types of structures such as bridges, dams, tunnels and piles. In order to monitor behaviour of concrete at the very early age a stiff SOFO sensor has been developed. Using standard SOFO sensor it is possible to measure deformation of concrete at the very early age (thermal swelling and shrinkage). However, by coupling it with a stiff sensor, it is possible to determine the hardening time of concrete and to measure initial stress in the rebars. The stiff sensor and the results obtained using its first prototype are presented in this paper.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:. Single Channel Seismic (SCS) is one of the earliest forms of seismic acquisition, and whilst modern broadband Multi Channel Seismic (MCS) set-ups can offer superior imaging, SCS remains an important tool offering simple, cost-effective data acquisition for many offshore engineering projects. This paper presents results from two offshore wind farm sites that demonstrate how application of seismic processing techniques typically reserved for MCS applications, can significantly enhance SCS data to support building foundation-zone ground models for engineering design.Elements of the acquisition, processing and interpretation are described which demonstrate best-practice and illustrate potential pitfalls of SCS survey planning. Comparison of MCS data demonstrates how post-processed SCS data can be used to develop site ground models to a significant degree of confidence prior to MCS data being acquired. Processed data examples from sparker and boomer sources demonstrate the ability to image to depths {$>$} 100 m below seabed. Optimisation of source and receiver configuration and latest technologies are explored. Properly acquired and processed SCS is also shown to be an appropriate tool for projects with a limited foundation depth of interest, such as floating offshore wind farm and transmission projects, and also in regions where geophysical data acquisition is challenging.1 Introduction1.1 Background to Single Channel Seismic. Single Channel Seismic (SCS), also known as Low Frequency Sub-Bottom Profiler (LF SBP) in offshore foundation zone applications, is a geological imaging technique where a seismic source, hydrophone and recorder are used to sample acoustic reflections generated at subsurface impedance contrasts. Historically, various systems were developed by industry using a range of sources that would form the basis of modern-day seismic acquisition (e.g. boomers, sparkers and air guns; see Trabant, 1984). Recent industry need, driven largely by offshore wind farm developments, is for Ultra-High Resolution (UHR) foundation zone imaging up to 100 m below seabed, with commonly deployed sources having dominant frequencies in the range of 0.5 to 3 kHz. The term SCS is used herein to refer to all systems where such UHR sources are paired with a single channel hydrophone and seismic recorder.},

  abstract = {When compressing soil, there is a characteristic relationship between compressive stress and volume change that can be used to define important soil mechanical properties. Two defining features can be determined - the compression index (Cc - the modulus of the slope of the linear virgin compression curve) and the precompression stress ( ?????p - the transition point between the elastic rebound curve and the virgin compression curve). These are indicators of compressibility and stress history respectively. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate different ways of estimating these indicators based on laboratory test data. Repacked soils with a range of textures were subjected to sequential compressions of 50, 100 and 200 kPa, which provided two compression characteristics with "known" ?????p of 50 and 100 kPa. Three functions were fitted to the measured test data (fourth-order polynomial, symmetrical logistic sigmoidal and asymmetrical Gompertz sigmoidal). Values of Cc were estimated by linear regression (for the data later fitted with a polynomial function) or by the tangent at the inflection point derived from model parameters (logistic and Gompertz functions). Three estimates of ?????p were calculated for each of the three functions: the standard Casagrande method (C), the intercept of the virgin compression curve and the initial (no stress) horizontal line (V-I), and the point of maximum curvature (MC) derived from the curvature function (??). The accuracy of estimating ?????p and the magnitude of Cc generally increased with clay content. Estimates of Cc based on sigmoidal curves did not differ greatly from the linear regression estimate. Sigmoidal curves yielded ?????p estimates with lower absolute deviations from known values than polynomial-based estimates. The MC calculation based on the Gompertz function gave the most accurate estimate of ?????p. The lower asymptote of sigmoidal curves may also correspond to the water-filled pore space. Thus, despite the fact that all three functions fitted the measured data equally well, characteristics based on the sigmoidal curves were deemed to be most appropriate. The greater accuracy of the prediction of ?????p favoured the Gompertz function. Wider applicability of this was further checked with data selected from an independent database on subsoil compaction. We recommend fitting the Gompertz function to measured soil compression characteristic test data, and to define Cc objectively as the modulus of the slope of the tangent at the inflection point, providing this lies within the measured data range, and ?????p as the point of maximum curvature as defined by ??. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The double-wall instrumentation allows independent measurements of the outer shaft, inner shaft (plug) and annulus resistances during a static load test. The residual loads locked in the pile after driving were measured and considered in the correction of the resistance components. The load--settlement curve, load transfer curves and the profile of the unit limit shaft resistance were obtained from the static load test measurements. Two cone penetration test-based methods were used to estimate the resistance of the test pile, which was compared with that obtained from the static load test. Both methods provide good estimates for the unit shaft resistance in sandy layers with low gravel content ({$<$}20\%), but significantly overestimate the unit shaft resistance mobilised in soil with high gravel content ({$>$}30\%). The estimated base resistances by both methods match well that measured in the static load test.},

  abstract = {Laboratory load tests were conducted on piles 15.9--38.1{\enspace}mm in diameter and up to 1.8{\enspace}m long in a compact dry sand. The piles were buried in the sand stratum during sand placement. Two conditions of test were imposed---in one the pile was free to settle as the sand was placed around it and in the other the top end of the pile was rigidly clamped thus preventing any movement of the pile during sand placement. The piles were provided with sensitive axial load transducers at their base and at seven positions along their length.During test preparation a residual force system was locked in the pile and it was found that this initial residual state controlled the subsequent load and movement behavior of the pile. Data are given which show the mechanics of load mobilization and sharing for piles of different length--diameter ratios between 10 and 112, different axial flexibilities, and different diameters. In addition one series of tests examined the significance of footings located at regular intervals along the pile shaft. It is shown very clearly that extensive arching occurs along the lower lengths of the piles thus confirming earlier work of Vesi{\'c}. The multiunderreamed pile is much more efficient than a straight sided pile of equal diameter. The mechanism of load development in a pile is not in agreement with any of the standard pile bearing capacity theories but agrees with concepts presented earlier by the authors. The significance of the experimental findings is discussed.},

This extension, named Extended Isolation Forest (EIF), resolves issues with assignment of anomaly score to given data points. We motivate the problem using heat maps for anomaly scores. These maps suffer from artifacts generated by the criteria for branching operation of the binary tree. We explain this problem in detail and demonstrate the mechanism by which it occurs visually. We then propose two different approaches for improving the situation. First we propose transforming the data randomly before creation of each tree, which results in averaging out the bias. Second, which is the preferred way, is to allow the slicing of the data to use hyperplanes with random slopes. This approach results in remedying the artifact seen in the anomaly score heat maps. We show that the robustness of the algorithm is much improved using this method by looking at the variance of scores of data points distributed along constant level sets. We report AUROC and AUPRC for our synthetic datasets, along with real-world benchmark datasets. We find no appreciable difference in the rate of convergence nor in computation time between the standard Isolation Forest and EIF.},

Understanding the resistance against lateral failure of these quays has been challenging due to uncertainties in their working principles, geometry, soil and structural properties. This paper proposes a Bayesian approach to include evidence from past loading situations and corresponding deformations into the reliability assessment. This approach enables refinement of the reliability predictions and parameter distribution uncertainties, leading to a more accurate prediction of the resistance against the lateral failure of historic quay wall. Depending on the type of evidence, an a-priori reliability prediction for a quay wall that fails to meet safety standards can be updated to any of the three consequence classes outlined in NEN8700. In a case study, a quay wall with an a-priori reliability of {$\beta$} = 1.5 has been increased to {$\beta$} = 3.2 by including evidence of an extreme survived load of 10 kN/m2 that resulted in displacements of less than 4 mm. This is a decrease in failure probability by two orders of magnitude, showing the potential impact of using observational information in combination with Bayesian updating.},

  abstract = {This paper links research questions in Quaternary geology with those in Palaeolithic archaeology. A detailed geological reconstruction of The Netherlands' south-west offshore area provides a stratigraphical context for archaeological and palaeontological finds. Progressive environmental developments have left a strong imprint on the area's Palaeolithic record. We highlight aspects of landscape evolution and related taphonomical changes, visualized in maps for critical periods of the Pleistocene in the wider southern North Sea region. The Middle Pleistocene record is divided into two palaeogeographical stages: the pre-Anglian/Elsterian stage, during which a wide land bridge existed between England and Belgium even during marine highstands; and the Anglian/Elsterian to Saalian interglacial, with a narrower land bridge, lowered by proglacial erosion but not yet fully eroded. The Late Pleistocene landscape was very different, with the land bridge fully dissected by an axial Rhine--Thames valley, eroded deep enough to fully connect the English Channel and the North Sea during periods of highstand. This tripartite staging implies great differences in (i) possible migration routes of herds of herbivores as well as hominins preying upon them, (ii) the erosion base of axial and tributary rivers causing an increase in the availability of flint raw materials and (iii) conditions for loess accumulation in northern France and Belgium and the resulting preservation of Middle Palaeolithic sites.

Ring shear experiments investigated the influences of interface position, displacement scale, normal stress level and particle size distribution on ultimate interface friction angle,   {$\mathbf{\delta}\prime$}cv . Grain crushing is shown to play an important role within a concentrated shear zone, and this process, along with changes in the roughness of the interface, could lead to {$\delta\prime$} values markedly different from those developed in conventional small-displacement direct shear tests. It is also shown that {$\delta\prime$} measurements at smaller displacements may depend on whether the interface is mounted above or below the sample, but that such differences diminish to zero when displacements are large. The finding that {$\delta\prime$} is strongly displacement-dependent over the single-millimetre to multiple-metre scale has many practical geotechnical engineering implications.},

We studied the influence of pore water pressure during rapid load tests and its effect on the widely used unloading point method to derive static pile capacity. This paper describes the testing programme and the test set-up. We present typical measurement results from a total of 36 rapid and 12 static load tests, as well as the effects of the loading rate and excess pore pressures on pile resistance. The tests confirm that a rapid load test can overestimate static capacity due to pore water pressure when testing piles in medium to fine sands. The results of the pore pressure measurements show a combination of positive and negative excess pore pressure in the zone around the pile base, which can be explained by compression, volumetric behaviour during shearing and pore fluid flow around the pile.},

The applicable ground conditions for this method have been significantly expanded by the `Rotary Cutting Press-in (RCP)' method, whereby a vertical jacking force and a torque are applied simultaneously onto a pile with cutting teeth on its base while water is injected around the pile base. In this paper, a method to estimate the base capacity of RCP piles is proposed based on the UWA-05 framework. The proposed method utilizes CPT (cone penetration test) or SPT (standard penetration test) results as the input parameters and estimates the plugging condition (Incremental Filling Ratio, IFR) from these results. Four static load tests on open-ended RCP piles are shown to have been predicted well by the proposed method in terms of the base capacity, regardless of the embedment depth into the bearing stratum.},

The main focus is on reporting and interpreting field observations that provide vital checks and benchmarks for modelling and identify key physical processes that might otherwise remain unrecognized. The latter include the time-dependent impacts on offshore foundation behaviour of consolidation, creep straining, geomaterial micro-to-macro fabric and in-situ chemical reactions.

The 56th Rankine Lecture considered one of the most pressing global problems: maintaining vital energy supplies while also recognising, mitigating and reducing the climate consequences of fossil fuel consumption. This written version reports geotechnical research relating to these wide-ranging issues, considering paired topics within its three main parts and illustrating these with specific practical examples. Part 1 focuses on supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, considering advances in understanding and designing the driven piles that support most continental shelf platforms, before moving to the large underwater landslides that can affect deeper water developments. Part 2 describes investigations into the geotechnical impact of climate change in a permafrost region and a peatland study that contributes to alleviating flood risks exacerbated by climate change. Part 3 outlines research that is improving the economics of renewable offshore wind energy for multi-pile and monopile supported turbines. Integrating geology and rigorous analysis with advanced laboratory and field experiments is shown to be essential to resolving the complex geotechnical problems considered, as is careful full-scale checking and monitoring. Close cooperation with co-workers from industry and academia was central to the studies described and the contributions of many collaborators are emphasised. The concluding section identifies examples of significant questions from each of the six topic areas that remain to be resolved fully.},

As well as showing considerable radial variation, the stresses developed at any given depth build sharply as the tip approaches, and reduce rapidly as it passes. Clear differences are evident between the behaviours seen close to the shaft during alternate penetration and pause periods. Load-cycling effects are most significant close to the shaft, where the local stress paths indicate a tendency for constrained `dilatant' behaviour, with radial stresses increasing, during loading. In contrast, markedly `contractant' radial stress reductions are evident on unloading.},

Many practical benefits follow if service capacities can be relied upon to exceed the levels proven in site tests, which are usually performed within a few days of driving. This paper reports findings from a programme of mainly tension tests on steel pipe piles performed in dense sand at Dunkirk, northern France. The tests demonstrated more marked shaft capacity growth with time than expected. The aged piles also showed surprisingly brittle failure modes; prior testing to failure both degraded capacity and modified the ageing processes, leading to non-monotonic shaft capacity--time traces that fall far below the intact ageing characteristic (IAC) defined by tests on fresh, previously unfailed, piles. Capacity--time trends inferred from repeatedly tested piles can give misleading results. The new findings allow the ageing effects to be characterised more clearly, and permit a re-evaluation of existing databases involving piles of various types driven in a range of silts, sands and gravels. Important practical conclusions are drawn regarding pile design and the interpretation of field pile load tests.},

It has performance characteristics of both displacement and non-displacement piles due to the way in which it is installed. Based on field experience, it has been shown that the load--settlement performance of CHD piles installed in sand exceeds the current design predictions based upon conservative effective pile diameter and design parameters associated with auger bored or continuous flight auger in situ piles. In an effort to gain a greater understanding of the performance of CHD piles in sand compared with more conventional piling techniques, a programme of physical model pile testing (reported in this paper) and associated finite-element modelling (reported in a companion paper) was undertaken. The model testing programme established that greater shaft resistance may be developed for the piles than had originally been considered. Based upon the results of the model testing, recommendations for more appropriate approaches to the selection of end bearing and shaft resistance factors are made to predict ultimate load capacity in sand.},

The results provide strong evidence that the presence and severity of neuropathic pain are associated with greater impairments in a number of important HRQoL domains. However, the evidence also indicates that this impact varies somewhat as a function of the HRQoL domain being considered and that different measures of HRQoL are differentially sensitive to the effects of neuropathic pain. The findings have important implications for the selection of HRQoL domains and measures to use in clinical trials and in clinical research on HRQoL in persons with neuropathic pain and suggest that a biopsychosocial (as opposed to a primarily biomedical) approach would be appropriate for understanding and treating neuropathic pain.},

  abstract = {The main objective of this study was to understand the effect of aging on the penetration resistance of freshly deposited sands. Two types of sand, locally available river sand used as masonry sand and Beaufort Sea sand, were selected for the study. The sands were allowed to age under a constant stress of 100{\enspace}kPa in a specially designed apparatus in a dry state, as well as submerged in distilled water and in simulated sea water. Penetration resistance of the sand beds was measured periodically by pushing 4 probes into the sand bed. Mineralogical and fabric studies on freshly deposited and aged sand samples were conducted to detect the effect of aging, if any, on sand grains. The results indicate that aging significantly increases the penetration resistance of sands. The rate of increase in penetration resistance was higher for the submerged sand as compared with the dry sand. The increase in penetration resistance of the sand in a dry state was attributed to rearrangement of sand grains. In the submerged state, besides the rearrangement of sand particles, partial cementation caused by precipitation of salts and probably also silica on the sand grains and in the pores resulted in the larger increase in the penetration resistance.

  abstract = {Site characterisation is an important task in geotechnical engineering practice. The ultimate goal in site characterisation is to be able to estimate in situ soil properties at any half-space point at a site based on limited tests. This estimate may be a point estimate or expressed in terms of some statistical parameters. Geostatistical and random field methods have been applied with limited success. This paper presents a new approach, based on artificial neural networks, for site characterisation. Emphasis is placed on the application of generalised regression neural networks for site characterisation. The results show that the neural network approach has the potential to be a practical tool for site characterisation.},

  abstract = {In geotechnical engineering, soil classification is an essential component in the design process. Field methods such as the cone penetration test (CPT) can be used as less expensive and faster alternatives to sample retrieval and testing. Unfortunately, current soil classification charts based on CPT data and laboratory measurements are too generic, and may not provide an accurate prediction of the soil type. A probabilistic approach is proposed here to update and modify soil identification charts based on site-specific CPT data. The probability that a soil is correctly classified is also estimated. The updated identification chart can be used for a more accurate prediction of the classification of the soil, and can account for prior information available before conducting the tests, site-specific data, and measurement errors. As an illustration, the proposed approach is implemented using CPT data from the Treporti Test Site (TTS) near Venice (Italy) and the National Geotechnical Experimentation Sites (NGES) at Texas A\&M University. The applicability of the site-specific chart for other sites in Venice Lagoon is assessed using data from the Malamocco test site, approximately 20 km from TTS.},

The methodology includes use of net cone resistance values normalised to vertical effective stress, a procedure for pairing of CPT data with CU test results, and definition of a practical failure criterion for deriving su from CU test data. The presented approach is particularly useful for application in offshore wind, where the economics of wind farm development favour performing only a single cone penetration test (CPT) per wind turbine location.

  abstract = {Earth-fill structures such as embankments, which are constructed for the preservation of land and infrastructure, show significant amount of settlement during and after construction in lowland areas with soft grounds. Settlements are often still predicted with large uncertainty and frequently observational methods are applied using settlement monitoring results in the early stage after construction to predict the long term settlement. Most of these methods require a significant amount of measurements to enable accurate predictions. In this paper, an artificial neural network model for settlement prediction is evaluated and improved using measurement records from a test embankment in The Netherlands. Based on a learning pattern that focuses on convergence of the settlement rate, the basic model predicted settlements which were in good agreement with the measurements, when the amount of measured data used as teach data for the model exceeded a degree of consolidation of 69 \{\%\}. For lower amounts of teach data the accuracy of settlement prediction was limited. To improve the accuracy of settlement prediction, it is proposed to add short-term predicted values that satisfy predefined statistical criteria of low coefficient of variance or low standard deviation to the teach data, after which the model is allowed to relearn and repredict the settlement. This procedure is repeated until all predicted values satisfy the criterion. Using the improved network model resulted in significantly better predictions. Predicted settlements were in good agreement with the measurements, even when only the measurements up to a consolidation stage of 35 \{\%\} were used as initial teach data. \{{\copyright}\} 2014 Springer International Publishing Switzerland.},

  abstract = {Distributed fibre optic sensing (DFOS) presents several advantages over traditional point sensors, for measuring strain and temperature in civil and geotechnical infrastructure. DFOS techniques use light transmitted through an optical fibre to enable measurements to be taken all along an embedded or surface-mounted fibre optic cable, which can be up to several kilometres long. This makes DFOS particularly useful for monitoring linear structures and to detect the potential existence of any anomalies which are usually unpredictable. Hence, DFOS has gained in popularity for monitoring reinforced concrete piles, especially during pile testing. The spatially continuous strain data from DFOS provide detailed information about load transfer along the pile but can also be used to calculate vertical displacements and shaft friction through numerical integration and differentiation, which are useful for validating relevant performance-based numerical models. This paper introduces the methodology and illustrates these advantages through an example obtained from an instrumented pile load test in London. While it synthesises a number of lessons learned in the application of DFOS for pile testing, it also supports the case for routine long-term monitoring of working piles.},

  abstract = {At the end of 2019, the European Union (EU) put forward the European Green Deal to facilitate the technological progress necessary to achieve CO2-neutrality by 2050. Such a monumental achievement would require massive investments in infrastructure for the harvesting, storage and the transnational transportation of green energy. To date, the more mature of the scalable (cf. to hydroelectric) green-energy resources is offshore wind, with joint academic and industry efforts allocated to reduce its capital expenditure. Approximately 13-37\% of the required investment for offshore wind farms is currently expended on the design, manufacturing, and installation of the substructure. Further reduction in the cost of offshore wind can be achieved by addressing the main technical challenges associated with the predominant offshore wind foundation, i.e., the monopile. The main challenges typically relate to its lifetime operations, namely, (i) the identification of the wind turbine's fundamental frequencies, which are strongly dependent on the monopile-soil interaction, (ii) and the prediction of the lifetime foundation tilt, but also the current installation technology (impact driving); the current norm in the offshore industry. In particular, impact driving is associated with (i) long installation times, especially in the presence of competent soils, (ii) excessive use of construction material (steel) to avoid pile damage under many hammer blows, and (iii) costly underwater noise mitigation measures to reduce noise the levels of installation-borne noise emissions harmful to marine life.In an attempt to accelerate the growth of offshore wind, the Netherlands, country of origin of this study, has supported several research initiatives to reduce the engineering and manufacturing costs for the prevalent offshore wind foundation in the country (the monopile). This study elaborates upon the experimental findings of two major research projects, namely the DISSTINCT (2014-2018) and the Gentle Driving of Piles (2018-2022) projects, each designed to address specific technical uncertainties associated with the foundation concept. The DISSTINCT project (launched in 2014) aimed to improve the understanding of the natural frequency of installed monopiles as well as the engineering procedures used in the identification thereof. By conducting experiments at full scale on a monopile installed in the IJsselmeer lake in the Netherlands, the experimental campaign produced invaluable data on the dynamic response of monopiles during small amplitude lateral vibrations. Later, the GDP project (launched in 2018) was designed to propose, engineer, and demonstrate a novel monopile installation procedure, foreseen to alleviate most of the aforementioned installation-related challenges; the Gentle Driving of Piles (GDP) method. Moreover, the project would provide answers to questions concerning the long-term response of (mono)piles in sandy soils, relative to the installation method. For these reasons, an extensive experimental campaign was conducted in the port of Rotterdam (Maasvlakte II), where a total of 9 piles were driven into the sandy Maasvlakte soil via different driving procedures, namely with the established impact hammering, the traditional axial vibro-driving, and the new GDP method. Subsequently, the cyclic lateral performance for four of these piles (which were heavily instrumented), was evaluated via an elaborate 82.000 load cycle ({$\approx$}42 hours) loading programme of slow (0.1 Hz) high amplitude, and fast (0.1 - 4 Hz) low amplitude cyclic force applied to the (mono)piles' head.   This study elaborates and builds upon experimental findings from the above-mentioned test campaigns. These measurements were first carefully examined, and later interpreted using a variety of modelling tools (both 1D and 3D FE modelling) formulated and adapted to meet the particular geotechnical and loading challenges of the examined fieldwork. Enabled by the diversity of the field and numerical work performed, this study addresses a number of engineering challenges and knowledge gaps related to the design of monopiles, namely i) their post-installation resonance frequency, ii) the long-term response to environmental loading, and iii) the impact of the installation method on the long-term operations.  In particular, 3D FE modelling was adopted to successfully simulate the dynamic response of the examined monopile in the DISSTINCT project. The modelling efforts enabled the interpretation of the field test measurements, and in turn, inspired confidence in the suitability of available simulation tools to identify the resonance frequencies of monopile foundations, and accurately calculate dynamic soil-monopile interactions. For the interpretation of the GDP field test data, 1D FE modelling was employed. In the field, the elaborate lateral loading programme returned a fairly complex cyclic pile response, with pronounced differences in the performance of piles installed by different installation methods. The particular geotechnical conditions at the GDP site, i.e., site inhomogeneity and the 4~m deep unsaturated topsoil, prevented the direct comparison of the installation methods. This was later achieved through the formulation of a cyclic soil reaction p-y model able to simulate soil ratcheting and gapping effects. The results provided rich insights into the impact of relevant installation effects on the cyclic pile response on many loading cycles  and indicated that the GDP-installed piles performed excellent overall in lateral cyclic loading.},

The accurate prediction of the ultimate bearing capacity of piles driven in mixed soil is more challenging than that of piles driven in either clay or sand because the mechanical behavior of these soils is better known. In order to study the behavior of closed-ended pipe piles driven into multilayered soil profiles, fully instrumented static and dynamic axial load tests were performed on three piles. One of these piles was tested dynamically and statically. A second pile served as reaction pile in the static load test and was tested dynamically. A third pile was tested dynamically. The base of each pile was embedded slightly in a very dense nonplastic silt layer overlying a clay layer. In this paper, results of these pile load tests are presented, and the lessons learned from the interpretation of the test data are discussed. A comparison is made of the ultimate base and limit shaft resistances measured in the pile load tests with corresponding values predicted from in situ test-based and soil property-based design methods.},

This can be attributed to the large volume of geotechnical survey data and uncertainties associated with the use of relevant stochastic and geostatistical approaches. This paper presents the design of an optimum deep neural network (DNN)-based learning model for reliable classification of geotechnical layers of the 3D underground space in Seoul, South Korea. A large-scale borehole database was created to this end using geotechnical-layer depths and 3D spatial coordinates of a borehole dataset for Seoul. It is based on stepwise outlier detection and has been preprocessed via correction and normalization of missing values. The best-fitting model was obtained by optimizing the hyperparameters of a DNN-based classifier, and its performance was evaluated in terms of precision and accuracy. Subsequently, a 3D grid network was established to facilitate local geotechnical-layer classification, and its performance was evaluated by applying the proposed DNN-based model for each unit lattice. The accuracy of the resulting 3D geotechnical-layer map was validated via a comparison against the corresponding thematically classified maps that depict the two-dimensional (2D) density of gravitational anomalies, 2D topsoil properties, and 3D geotechnical-layer classification based on geostatistical conditional simulations.},

These requirements are organized and clarified in the paper. It also describes the hybrid Brillouin-Rayleigh system, which exhibits capabilities surpassing those of strain gauges.

Brillouin optical time-domain reflectometry (BOTDR) is an innovative technique that allows measurement of full strain profiles using standard optical fibres. Distributed optical fibre strain sensors were installed at two sites, and the details of the installation methods are presented. A theoretical analysis that compares pile behaviour evaluated from localised strain measurement at discrete locations and from distributed strain measurements is conducted for the case of a vertically loaded pile in layered soil. Two problems are considered: a load test aiming to establish the load transfer function, and changes in pile--soil interface stress due to nearby tunnelling. Advantages of such a distributed reading for monitoring the performance of pile foundations in layered soils are demonstrated from the results of both cases. Cost analysis results show that the BOTDR measurement is a cost-effective pile monitoring method compared with discrete strain measurement methods such as vibrating-wire strain gauges and fibre Bragg gratings.},

The procedures are validated against a database of physical model tests (reported in a companion paper), where they are shown to be suitable for estimating the load--settlement behaviour of CHD piles within the serviceability range. In this way they are complementary to the analytical method reported in the companion paper for estimating the ultimate capacity of a CHD pile. In this paper, the finite-element method and analytical model are applied to four historical load tests on CHD piles conducted at three different sand sites. The modelling is further validated and used to discuss potential savings in pile material and therefore cost due to additional confidence in performance determination at both ultimate and serviceability limit states.},

The jet assisted installation is based on the reduction of the soil resistance on the inside of a pile, using a water jetting gun technique (jetring), by fluidizing the interface between the inner pile wall and soil plug. The most decisive parameters in the driveability analysis were (i) the ones related to operational data such as hammer settings and crane load and (ii) the ones related to selection of vibratory driving parameters and the method used for estimating the soil resistance to driving. The applied driveability backanalysis predicts penetration speeds that are in relatively good agreement with measurements in the field. Results have also shown that the vibrojetting technique is promising in improving installation performance.},

  abstract = {A quay wall directly next to a building, both dating from around 1870, collapsed along the Grimburgwal in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, on 1 September 2020. The historic quay wall consisted of a masonry wall, built of a timber deck supported by several rows of timber piles of about 12\,m long. As over 200 km of such quays exists in Amsterdam and streets are usually very busy, the collapse triggered the question of the safety of the remaining quay walls in the city. A forensic investigation was carried out to determine the failure mechanisms and factors that contributed to the collapse. The investigation aimed to learn from this event and to prevent similar failures in the future. The main failure mechanisms and contributing factors were identified and confirmed using an integrated model of the quay, which is both simple and robust. The model was used to perform a sensitivity study taking all relevant uncertain factors into account. This work provided valuable insight into the main collapse mechanisms of the wall. Based on the results of this forensic study, it is possible to assess other historic quays.},

CPT sounds the mechanical behaviour of subsurface layers when penetrated with a cone, and is the most widely used site investigation method in the Netherlands. In this study 41 peat layers in the coastal--deltaic plainwere sounded, and subsequently cored for determination of peat type, organic matter content, degree of decomposition and void ratio. The results revealed that cone resistance depends on the void ratio of the peat layer. The compression parameters coefficient of volume compressibility (mv) and compression index (Cc) were derived from this. The results further revealed that the compressibility of the peat increases with increasing organic matter content. It is concluded that for mapping the susceptibility of the coastal--deltaic plain to future subsidence by peat compression, CPT has the potential to become a useful tool, as thousands of CPTs are conducted in the Netherlands each year, and their logged measurements are stored in a freely accessible national database.}

Quantifying current and predicting future subsidence are essential to sustain the viability of these areas with respect to rising sea levels. Despite its scale and severity, methods to quantify subsidence are scarce. In peat-rich subsidence hot spots, subsidence is often caused by peat compression. We introduce the standard Cone Penetration Test (CPT) as a technique to quantify subsidence due to compression of peat. In a test in the Holland coastal plain, the Netherlands, we found a strong relationship between thickness reduction of peat and cone resistance, due to an increase in peat stiffness after compression. We use these results to quantify subsidence of peat in subsiding areas of Sacramento-San Joaquin delta and Kalimantan, and found values corresponding with previously made observations. These results open the door for CPT as a new method to document past and predict future subsidence due to peat compression over large areas.},

Numerous correlations between these types of tests and the necessary soil parameters exist in the literature, but they have not been synthesized previously into readily form in a collective work. This manual summarizes the most pertinent of these available correlations for estimating soil parameters. In many cases, the existing correlations have been updated with new data, and new correlations have been developed where sufficient data have been available. For each soil parameter, representative correlations commonly are presented in chronological order to illustrate the evolutionary development of the particular correlation. The emphasis is on relatively common laboratory and in-situ tests and correlations, including those tests that are seeing increased use in practice.},

These parameters can be determined by carrying out laboratory oedometer test on undisturbed samples; however, the test is quite time-consuming and expensive. Therefore, many empirical formulas based on regression analysis have been presented to estimate the compressibility parameters using soil index properties. In this paper, an artificial neural network (ANN) model is suggested for prediction of compressibility parameters from basic soil properties. For this purpose, the input parameters are selected as the natural water content, initial void ratio, liquid limit and plasticity index. In this model, two output parameters, including compression index and recompression index, are predicted in a combined network structure. As the result of the study, proposed ANN model is successful for the prediction of the compression index, however the predicted recompression index values are not satisfying compared to the compression index.},

The guidelines require that if newer methods are to be implemented in design, the same level of safety shall be docu-mented for these methods as for existing methods. The designer is required to select an appropriate safety factor when using the newer design methods. The challenge lies in deciding which safety factor will ensure a consistent safety level for different soil conditions and pile dimensions. To evaluate the required material factor, the probability of failure was quantified in two case studies for piles designed with the API method and with the newer NGI, ICP and Fugro methods. A calibration of the required material factor for a target probability of failure of 10-4/yr was also performed. The results show that the annual reliability index and probability of failure vary with the axial pile capacity calculation method. The study provides a contribution to the discussion on the reliability of the API, the NGI, the ICP and the Fugro methods. The material factor needs to be associated with the characteristic soil parameters selected for design. A large number of case studies should be added to quantify the reliability and the required material factor for each pile capacity method. The findings on margin of safety and the definition of the characteristic shear strength have important implications for the design of piles offshore and can result in significant savings.Introduction. Ensuring adequate reliability under severe loading conditions is a necessary consideration for offshore platforms, and the safety margin depends on the uncertainty in the parameters entering the analyses, in addition to the model uncertainty.

To investigate the effects of polymer and bentonite fluids on the behaviour of bored piles, a field trial comprising three full-scale instrumented test piles has been conducted at a site in East London. It was found that the two piles constructed using polymer fluids showed much stiffer load-settlement response than the one constructed using bentonite slurry. Surprisingly, an extended pile bore open time of up to 26h was found to have no adverse effect on the piles if supported by polymer fluids. Based on the results of back-analyses using the load-transfer approach, polymer fluids were found to have little effect on the Woolwich and Reading Formations but a noticeable effect on the Upnor Formation -- the mixed results are believed be due to the different soil mineralogies. It has also been shown that the common problem of `soft toes' can be eliminated by adopting good construction practice including proper base checking and fluid cleaning or exchange procedures on site.},

For port facilities, the need for sensor-based monitoring is increasing to analyze the effects of various factors such as aging, ship activities, backfill earth pressure, and waves. However, few researchers have conducted long-term monitoring of caisson quay walls. In this study, an SHM system was developed with different types of sensors installed on two caisson quay walls and monitored over one year. A new online adaptive anomaly detection approach was proposed to identify the anomalous status of each caisson in real-time by analyzing multiple variables. The method was validated with seven simulated anomaly scenarios, demonstrating high accuracy in anomaly detection despite significant environmental variations, outperforming other approaches. These results highlight the potential to provide timely and accurate alerts when anomalous states occur in port structures.},

First, it is demonstrated directly that the stresses developed at any given soil horizon depend strongly on both the distance of that horizon from the pile tip and the soil's initial state. Second, pile loading is shown to induce radial effective stress changes associated with the soil fabric set up by installation and dilation phenomena at pile-soil interface. Thirdly, the operational angles of interface friction are found to be constant volume values that correlate well with the results from laboratory interface shear tests.},

The penetration resistances are compared with the properties of kaolin as measured in element tests to assist in the development of a framework that describes this resistance over the full velocity range. Consistent trends emerge when the soil viscosity is assumed to affect the penetration resistance in both the partially drained and undrained conditions, enabling the dependence of the T-bar and ball resistances on diameter, velocity and soil characteristics to be quantified.},

The data enables sub-surface geo-characterisation in high-resolution, down to the basement at a depth of about 175m. Correlations between shear-wave velocity and Janbu's classical 1D consolidation parameters (m, M0, M1, {$\sigma\prime$}c and OCR) are used for settlement analysis. Both the magnitude and rate of time-settlement predictions compare well with the measured settlements from GPS levelling and PSInSAR data acquired since the late 1980s and the early 1990s in the area, respectively. The shear-wave reflection data further provide important input to understand the spatial patterns of land-subsidence in the Trondheim harbour. The highest settlement rates occur in areas where depth to bedrock is greatest and where thicker deposits with low stiffness are found. In summary, the data and workflow presented here are useful tools for predicting settlements based on correlations with shear-wave velocity measurements.},

  abstract = {Steel casing is commonly used in drilled shaft construction to maintain the integrity of the borehole during drilling; however, little guidance regarding the effect of the casing on axial load transfer exists in the literature. To address this aspect of drilled shaft design and construction, this paper presents a study of axial load transfer of drilled shaft foundations using four, full-scale, instrumented drilled shafts: two uncased and two cased drilled shafts. Axial loading tests were performed and used to compare various performance metrics between the cased and uncased shafts, including the axial load-displacement curves, load transfer distributions and back-calculated unit shaft resistance-relative displacement relationships (t-z curves). The uncased test shafts exhibited significantly greater axial shaft resistance compared to the cased test shafts, and data from thermal integrity profiler (TIP) sensors allowed interpretation of the differences in soil-shaft contact conditions and the resulting load transfer. Although the ultimate axial resistance of the uncased test shafts could not be mobilised, sufficient data were developed to allow comparison to the cased test shafts and extrapolation to anticipated ultimate resistance conditions. The back-calculated t-z curves of the uncased test shafts were modelled and used to estimate the anticipated large deformation response. Based on observations in this study and those previously reported, the effects of permanent casing on axial load transfer are summarised to provide an up-to-date reference on the reductions expected based on construction sequencing and installation methods.},

  abstract = {This article examines the role and the efficiency of nonconvex loss functions for binary classification problems. In particular, we investigate how to design adaptive and effective boosting algorithms that are robust to the presence of outliers in the data or to the presence of errors in the observed data labels. We demonstrate that nonconvex losses play an important role for prediction accuracy because of the diminishing gradient properties---the ability of the losses to efficiently adapt to the outlying data. We propose a new boosting framework called ArchBoost that uses diminishing gradient property directly and leads to boosting algorithms that are provably robust. Along with the ArchBoost framework, a family of nonconvex losses is proposed, which leads to the new robust boosting algorithms, named adaptive robust boosting (ARB). Furthermore, we develop a new breakdown point analysis and a new influence function analysis that demonstrate gains in robustness. Moreover, based only on local curvatures, we establish statistical and optimization properties of the proposed ArchBoost algorithms with highly nonconvex losses. Extensive numerical and real data examples illustrate theoretical properties and reveal advantages over the existing boosting methods when data are perturbed by an adversary or otherwise. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

The proposal is based on the findings from pile test programmes performed at a test bed site in Western Australia in addition to data from well-documented full-scale pile tests. The investigation reveals a significant influence of installation disturbance on the subsequent gain in capacity (set-up) of shaft friction. Set-up is viewed as a recovery process, rather than a capacity gain, following the disturbance induced by pile installation. Gains in capacity in the medium and longer term tend to vary with the logarithm of time, while capacity changes shortly after installation are seen to be relatively small. A new expression is proposed to represent this ageing characteristic, which also incorporates a limiting (or maximum available) shaft friction.},

Several attempts have been made to model the phenomenon using small-scale physical models in a controlled environment, but the investigations were hampered by numerous restrictions. This paper describes an improved small-scale model pile experiment designed to investigate the ageing effects of pile shaft friction in sand. Details of the experimental set-up adopted and procedures employed are presented. Results show that the phenomenon of pile set-up is successfully modelled and that load--displacement characteristics are in keeping with those observed in centrifuge tests. Although the ageing effects observed in this laboratory-scale physical model may not be directly applicable to field scale piles, comparative studies involving various influential parameters provide qualitative indications of the relative influence of a variety of parameters on the phenomenon.},

The results confirm that the gains in shaft capacity of jacked piles are small after a period of about 1 day. This observation is in keeping with limited available case history data, but is in stark contrast to the significant capacity gains reported for driven piles. Further examination reveals that set-up effects for jacked piles in sand are relatively significant within one day of installation, and that the increased friction is associated primarily with larger increases in radial effective stress during shearing.},

A precise characterization of these uncertainties is a significant challenge primarily because of limited data availability. The Bayesian theory provides a means for updating these uncertainties by incorporating prior statistical information and observations. However, conventional Bayesian inference focuses on limited sources of uncertainties. This paper presents a probabilistic back analysis method for improved reliability of subsequent predictions that considers all the uncertainties. Three distinct features of this new method include: (1) multiple observations are incorporated into the Bayesian updating, (2) the statistical information of the uncertain variables is updated in a stage-by-stage manner, and (3) the posterior distributions of uncertain variables are derived with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation that is based on the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm. Two case histories, including a braced excavation problem and a tunnel excavation problem, are analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. The advantages of this new back analysis method over the conventional Bayesian updating analyses are documented.},

Higher elevations for these variables, or waterproof protection of backup generators, could have mitigated or prevented the disaster. We collected information on these variables, along with historical data on run-up heights, for 89 coastal nuclear power plants in the world. The data shows that 1. Japanese plants were relatively unprotected against potential inundation in international comparison, but there was considerable variation for power plants within and outside of Japan; 2. Older power plants and plants owned by the largest utility companies appear to have been particularly unprotected.},

Reliability sensitivity analysis of monitoring variables provides a rational approach for identifying sensitive monitoring variables and is capable of accounting for geotechnical uncertainties. It, however, can be computationally expensive, especially when sophisticated numerical models (e.g., finite difference model, FDM) are involved and repeated simulation runs are required. This paper proposes a reliability sensitivity analysis method that leverages on the robustness of direct Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) and the Bayesian Updating with Structural Reliability Methods. The proposed approach allows performing the reliability sensitivity analysis of a monitoring variable by a single run of direct MCS, avoiding repeated simulation runs for different possible observational values of a given monitoring variable. Illustrative examples demonstrate the capability of the proposed approach in identifying the most sensitive monitoring variables among candidates. It is possible to achieve a significant reduction in the number of evaluations of numerical models for reliability sensitivity analysis of monitoring variables using the proposed approach.},

It is shown that the key parameters for the plugging mechanism are the pile radius, the shape of the impact load, the shear wave velocity of the soil inside the pile, and the friction at the pile--soil interface. Consequently, the tendency of the pile to plug during driving can be assessed prior to the driving process by consideration of these key parameters. Existing one-dimensional models for the shaft response of open-ended piles are discussed and an improved model is presented. The differences between using one-dimensional models and finite element models to simulate the plugging process are examined. The differences are found to vary with the key parameters. Pile-in-pile and lumped-mass one-dimensional models are found to give satisfactory performance for some parameter combinations, while for others an axisymmetric finite element model must be used. {\copyright} 1998 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

It incorporates random field simulations and a surrogate modeling technique into the Bayesian updating framework, while the spatial and stage-dependent correlations of model bias can also be considered. The approach is illustrated using two cases of multi-stage braced excavations, one being a hypothetical scenario and the other from a case study in Hong Kong. Making use of all the deflection measurements along an inclinometer, the principal components of the random field and model bias factors can be updated efficiently as the instrumentation data become available. These various sources of uncertainty do not only cause discrepancies between prior predictions and actual performance, but can also lead to response mechanisms that cannot be captured by deterministic approaches, such as distortion of the wall along the longitudinal direction of the excavation. The proposed approach addresses these issues in an efficient manner, producing prediction intervals that reasonably encapsulate the response uncertainty as shown in the two cases. The capability to continuously refine the response estimates and prediction intervals can help support the decision-making process as the construction progresses.},

These embankments are located on very soft glacial lake clay, highly compressible organic clay and calcareous marls, the geotechnical properties of which were largely unknown at the commencement of design in the early 1980s. Comparisons between compressibility, consolidation and shear strength parameters derived during the site investigation and those measured by monitoring the works are presented in this paper. It was found, for example, that the installation of vertical drains can significantly alter consolidation behaviour, that field compressibility was greater than that expected from laboratory testing, and that lateral movement monitoring was a useful indicator of embankment instability. Data from the construction of the Athlone embankments also confirm that the field vane strength underestimates the operational strength of the clays, owing to a combination of anisotropic and vane insertion disturbance effects. Good estimates of the operational strength are given by the piezocone. Details of some investigative work carried out on the soils beneath the embankments, some nine years after completion of construction, are also presented. It was shown that this testing confirms the findings of Mesri (1989) that the increase in shear strength is approximately equal to 0{$\cdot$}22{$\Delta\sigma\prime$}v. Also, the piezocone is capable of defining zones of anisotropy induced by embankment loading.},

This paper describes its use in offshore geotechnical investigations (underwater MASW - UMASW) where the focus was on the upper 15\,m of the sediment profile to aid the design of structures such as marine pipelines, cable routes and shallow anchor systems. UMASW was shown to provide reliable data in Irish offshore conditions in water depths of up to 50\,m. The receiver spacing and array length, rather than the characteristics of the air gun seismic energy source, were the primary control on signal penetration and resolution of individual sediment layers. Good resolution of the properties of the upper 5\,m of sediment was found by reducing the receiver spacing to as low as 0.3\,m. A test site, with a broad intertidal zone, allowed coincident land, marine and direct measurements to be compared and Vs profiles obtained from UMASW, onshore MASW and by seismic cone testing (SCPTU) were in good agreement. Vs profiles estimated from published correlations with CPTU data in sandy sediments agreed well with the measured values. Inversion of data using different software packages showed only a minor variation in results.}

Indeed most research into sampling disturbance effects on soft clays has proven that use of poor-quality tube samplers ultimately leads to lower undrained strength, stiffness and preconsolidation stress than actually exist in situ. There is some evidence to suggest that this may not hold true for `intermediate' clay/silts or laminated soils. These issues were investigated for the Athlone laminated clay/silt, and it was found that tube sampling disturbance leads to increase in stiffness and undrained strength, and induces a strong tendency for dilatant behaviour post peak. These findings were made by comparing tube sample data with data from high-quality Sherbrooke block sampling and full-scale field trials. From the results of this investigation, and from comparisons with other soils, it is concluded that undrained tube sampling strains have only a minor influence, and that the behaviour of these medium plasticity clay/silts is due mainly to partially drained tube insertion process. Engineers dealing with soft `intermediate' or laminated soils need to assess the laboratory-derived parameters carefully, especially when the clay content is less than about 40\% and the plasticity index is less than 20\%.}

  abstract = {A digital twin (DT) refers to a digital replica of physical assets, processes, and systems. DTs integrate artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics to create living digital simulation models that are able to learn and update from multiple sources as well as represent and predict the current and future conditions of physical counterparts. However, current activities related to DTs are still at an early stage with respect to buildings and other infrastructure assets from an architectural and engineering/construction point of view. Less attention has been paid to the operation and maintenance (O\&M) phase, which is the longest time span in the asset life cycle. A systematic and clear architecture verified with practical use cases for constructing a DT would be the foremost step for effective operation and maintenance of buildings and cities. According to current research about multitier architectures, this paper presents a system architecture for DTs that is specifically designed at both the building and city levels. Based on this architecture, a DT demonstrator of the West Cambridge site of the University of Cambridge in the UK was developed that integrates heterogeneous data sources, supports effective data querying and analysis, supports decision-making processes in O\&M management, and further bridges the gap between human relationships with buildings/cities. This paper aims at going through the whole process of developing DTs in building and city levels from the technical perspective and sharing lessons learned and challenges involved in developing DTs in real practices. Through developing this DT demonstrator, the results provide a clear roadmap and present particular DT research efforts for asset management practitioners, policymakers, and researchers to promote the implementation and development of DT at the building and city levels.},

Parallel laboratory tests have been carried out on high-quality block samples and ordinary piston tube samples from 12 deposits of soft Norwegian marine clays. Undrained triaxial and direct simple shear (DSS) tests on samples reconsolidated to the in situ effective stresses show that sample disturbance has a significant effect on the measured stress--strain--strength behaviour: the more disturbed the sample, the lower the shear stress at small strains and the higher the shear stress at large strains. Breakdown of the clay structure, including cementation bonds, is the assumed cause of lower shear resistance at small strains, whereas at large strains the shear resistance is governed mainly by the water content, which for soft clay samples, reconsolidated to the in situ effective stresses, will be lower, and the strength thereby higher, the more disturbed the sample. The work described herein also includes the effects of the consolidation procedure; in addition to the reconsolidation technique, both stress history and normalized soil engineering properties (SHANSEP) and delayed consolidation tests have been carried out.Key words: soft clays, sample disturbance, consolidation procedures, stress--strain--strength behaviour, stress--strain--time behaviour.}

  abstract = {In recent years, the suction bucket foundation (SBF) has emerged as a preferred option for offshore wind turbines. However, accurately predicting penetration resistance remains a critical challenge, essential for determining self-weight penetration depth and the required suction during installation. Typically, SBF installation comprises two phases: the self-weight penetration phase and the suction-assisted installation phase. The current cone penetration test (CPT)-based prediction method primarily focuses on the suction installation phase, utilising only one set of design parameters (i.e. kp and kf). As a result, design parameters are typically calibrated against available installation data to achieve agreement for the suction installation phase, overlooking discrepancies in the predicted self-weight installation phase. The accuracy of predicted self-weight penetration significantly influences the evaluation of lifting crane operation, safety, the magnitude of suction pressure, and tilt of the suction bucket foundation system. This study addresses the reasons for these discrepancies and identifies shortcomings in the current CPT method. It introduces a new set of design parameters for evaluating the self-weight penetration phase, incorporating soil classification and distinguishing between the self-weight penetration (SWP) and suction penetration phases. Leveraging data from 35 SBF field installation sites in the South China Sea, back calculations are conducted to propose design parameters for SWP depth evaluation. The study underscores the importance of considering SBF installation in two distinct phases, providing fresh insights for enhanced design guidance, and highlights the economic and technical advancements in design practice with the new set of design parameters for SWP.},

However, unlike a virtual prototype, a digital twin is a virtual instance of a physical system (twin) that is continually updated with the latter's performance, maintenance, and health status data throughout the physical system's life cycle. This paper presents an overall vision and rationale for incorporating digital twin technology into MBSE. The paper discusses the benefits of integrating digital twins with system simulation and Internet of Things (IoT) in support of MBSE and provides specific examples of the use and benefits of digital twin technology in different industries. It concludes with a recommendation to make digital twin technology an integral part of MBSE methodology and experimentation testbeds.},

Therefore, it is of great significance to accurately and efficiently excavate the hidden information of the uplift pressure monitoring data to clarify the safety state of the concrete dam. Therefore, in this paper, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) method is used to intelligently identify the abnormal occurrence point and abnormal stable stage in the monitoring data. Then, an application method of measured uplift pressure is put forward to accurately reflect the spatial distribution and abnormal position of uplift pressure in the dam foundation. It is easy to calculate and connect with the finite element method through self-written software. Finally, the measured uplift pressure is applied to the finite element model of the concrete dam. By comparing the structural behavior of the concrete dam under the design and measured uplift pressure, the influence of abnormal uplift pressure on the safety state of the concrete dam is clarified, which can guide the project operation. Taking a 98.5 m concrete arch dam in western China as an example, the above analysis ideas and calculation methods have been verified. The abnormal identification method and uplift pressure applying method can provide ideas and tools for the structural diagnosis of a concrete dam.},

  abstract = {Aggregate resource assessments, derived from three subsequent generations of voxel models, were compared in a qualitative way to illustrate and discuss modelling progress. We compared the models in terms of both methodology and usability. All three models were produced by the Geological Survey of the Netherlands. Aggregate is granular mineral material used in building and construction, and in this case consists of sand and gravel. On each occasion ever-increasing computer power allowed us to model at a higher resolution and use more geological information to constrain interpolations. The two oldest models, built in 2005 and 2007, were created specifically for aggregate resource assessments, the first as proof of concept, the second for an online resource information system. The third model was derived from the ongoing multipurpose systematic 3D modelling programme GeoTOP. We used a study area of 40 {\texttimes} 40 km located in the central Netherlands, which encompasses a section of the Rhine-Meuse delta and adjacent glacial terrains to the north. Aggregate resource assessments rely on the extent to which the occurrence and grain size of sand and gravel are resolved, and on proper representation of clay and peat layers (overburden and intercalations) that affect exploitability. Average model properties (e.g. total aggregate content) are about the same in all three models, except for a difference resulting from converting older lithological classifications to the current one. This difference illustrates that data selection and preparation are paramount, especially when dealing with quality issues. Generally speaking the results of the aggregate resource assessments are consistent and satisfactory for all three models, provided that they are judged at the appropriate scale. However, the assessments based on GeoTOP best approach the desired scale of use for the aggregates industry; in that sense progress was significant and each model was a better fit for the purpose.},

This has a significant impact on the dimensions of pile foundations. Consequently, in situ load tests were considered in the Port of Rotterdam. In this study, full-scale static load tests (SLT) were conducted on four prefabricated concrete piles (36 m long), in order to optimize the design of a new quay wall. The test piles were instrumented with several types of optical fibers along the length, enabling detailed registration of shaft friction and base resistance. Since the optical fibers were already installed at casting, unique insights have been acquired regarding the residual stresses in the piles after hardening. These stresses are commonly not taken into consideration, resulting in underestimation of base capacity in favor of shaft. Since the test piles were loaded after different time periods, the effect of aging was additionally investigated in this study. After the completion of the SLT's, fully instrumented rapid load tests (RLT) were conducted on the same four piles. Subsequently, this provided the opportunity to compare and correlate the results of SLT and RLT for different soil types. This paper presents the results, conclusions and recommendations that follow from these tests. The results of this study have been used to optimize the design of the quay wall by reducing the number of piles by approximately 25\% and hence, the overall construction costs by 5\%.},

Due to the distributed nature of fiber optic sensor, BOTDR not only useful to monitor the structures deformation in terms of global behavior, but also effectively detects anomalies in localized scale. Since the sensor has the ability to measure strain and temperature simultaneously, it is important that methods to separate the temperature effects are fully understood. Four known methods used to compensate temperature from BOTDR strain readings are briefly reviewed. Regardless of what method being used, this paper aims to clarify the importance of firstly calibrating the thermal characteristic of optical cables and determine the coefficient thermal expansion of the measurement host or structure. Example of BOTDR thermal measurement of an earth retaining structure is presented.}

This study is aimed to show the feasibility of Random Set Finite Element Method (RS-FEM) and Event Tree Analysis (ETA) in assessing the reliability and risk to fatality of urban excavations. In order to fulfill this aim, a case study (22-meter excavation) which is stabilized with soil anchors is considered in North of Tehran, Iran. Prior to risk assessment, the failure probability of the deep excavation is estimated using RS-FEM, which is a relatively novel method in analyzing the reliability of deep excavations. Findings of the reliability analysis suggest that the upper and lower bounds of failure probabilities (Pf) for the considered case study are 0.0002 and 0.00001, respectively. Subsequently, using ETA, different possible scenarios, which may lead to fatality, are defined and proper probabilities are assigned to each scenario. Finally, for risk quantification purposes, the outcome probability of each scenario is multiplied by a considered Value of Statistical Life (VSL) as well as an aversion factor. Overall, findings recommend that the presented methodology (i.e. RS-FEM coupled with ETA) can be employed for Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) in deep urban excavations. Nevertheless, further research is recommended for other case studies as practicing the aforementioned method can constitute common sense on QRA of deep excavations.},

The aim of the work was to locate and document any archaeological remains in submerged Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene deposits at a depth of 22m to 17m bsl, in the to-be-deepened and extended harbour. A drowned Lateglacial-Early Holocene floodplain landscape was mapped and a Mesolithic site was discovered in it. The site was visited from c. 8500 to 6500 BC and became a nodal base camp 7000 to 6500 BC, when a wetland landscape had developed around it. Abundant flint tools, bones (of mammals, fish and bird) and plant material (pristine and charred) were recovered and provide information on mobility, diet and use of fire in the Middle Mesolithic. The site rapidly drowned in the transgressing North Sea owing to accelerated sea-level rise events of the period 6500-6300 BC. The site offers a window to the lowland archaeology of the Early Holocene in areas now offshore, that inland sites cannot off. The discoveries allow interregional comparison of delta habitation between the Middle Mesolithic (offshore, at depth in the sea, Doggerland) and Late Mesolithic (onshore, Rhine-Meuse delta, at depth below urbanized coastal plain).},

Instrumentation within the sphere measured accelerations along three orthogonal axes. The resultant acceleration was used to calculate sphere velocities and displacements. This allowed the penetration resistance acting on the sphere to be expressed in terms of a single capacity factor that captures soil resistance from both shearing and drag, and varies uniquely with the non-Newtonian Reynolds number. Undrained shear strength profiles obtained from a simple inverse analysis of the acceleration data show good agreement with those obtained using conventional push-in penetrometer tests.},

Despite increasing employment of these piles, the extent of research works does not yet suffice the requisites to reach a routine design. This paper aims to analyze six cone penetration test (CPT)-based methods of determining the bearing capacity of DDP. The statistical and reliability-based approaches were used in two parts of assessing performance of the methods with respect to soil--pile characteristics followed by evaluating reliability of the prediction outcome. A database is compiled including 65 DDP load tests with adjacent CPT profiles. Performance of the methods are analyzed. Finally, a reliability parameter, i.e., confidence interval, is introduced to demonstrate a more realistic insight into the evaluations by expressing performance of the methods in terms of a range for possible average values of the predictions ratios, rather than simply an arithmetic mean. The study reveals that the commonly used CPT-based methods which have not been specifically developed for DDP show great potential for design. The results indicate that the investigated methods can have promising performance if some modifications are applied.},

  abstract = {Structural health monitoring (SHM) using dynamic response measurement has received tremendous attention over the last decades. In practical circumstances, outliers may exist in the measurements that lead to undesirable identification results. Therefore, detection and special treatment of outliers are important. Unfortunately, this issue has rarely been taken into systematic consideration in SHM. In this paper, a novel outlier-resistant extended Kalman filter (OR-EKF) is proposed for outlier detection and robust online structural parametric identification using dynamic response data possibly contaminated with outliers. Instead of definite judgment on the outlierness of a data point, the proposed OR-EKF provides the probability of outlier for the measurement at each time step. By excluding the identified outliers, the OR-EKF ensures the stability and reliability of the estimation. In the illustrative examples, the OR-EKF is applied to parametric identification for structural systems with time-varying stiffness in comparison with the plain EKF. The structural response measurements are contaminated with outliers in addition to Gaussian noise. The proposed OR-EKF is capable of outlier detection, and it can capture the degrading stiffness trend with more stable and reliable results than the EKF.},

  abstract = {Inland navigation structures (INS) facilitate transportation of goods in rivers and canals. Transportation of goods over waterways is more energy efficient than on roads and railways. INS, similar to other civil structures, are aging and require frequent condition assessment and maintenance. Countries, in which INS are important to their economies, such as the Netherlands and the United States, allocate significant budgets for maintenance and renovation of exiting INS, as well as for building new structures. Timely maintenance and early detection of a change to material or geometric properties (i.e., damage) can be supported with the structural health monitoring (SHM), in which monitored data, such as load, structural response, environmental actions, are analyzed. Huge scientific efforts are realized in bridge SHM, but when it comes to SHM of INS, the efforts are significantly lower. Therefore, the SHM community has opportunities to develop new solutions for SHM of INS and convince asset owners of their benefits. This review article, first, articulates the need to keep INS safe to use and fit for purpose, and the challenges associated with it. Second, it defines and reviews sensors, sensing technologies, and approaches for SHM of INS. Then, INS and their components, including structures in ports, are identified, described, and illustrated, and their monitoring efforts are reviewed. Finally, the review article emphasizes the added value of SHM systems for INS, concludes on the current achievements, and proposes future trajectories for SHM of INS and ports.},

  abstract = {Purpose Industry 4.0 is predicted to be a game-changer, revolutionizing commercial and manufacturing practices through improved knowledge utilization and efficiencies. The barriers however, are significant, and the construction industry remains notoriously slow to take up innovations. This study reviews the research work in Industry 4.0 as it relates to construction, and examines a leading UK-based construction firm to ascertain the prognosis for Industry 4.0 roll-out in terms of the impediments and opportunities. Design/methodology/approach A multistage mixed philosophies and methods approach was adopted for this study. First, an interpretivist epistemological lens was used to synthesise extant literature as a means of contextualizing the present study. Second, an empirical case study using a post-positivist stance and inductive reasoning was conducted to explore practitioner acceptance of Industry 4.0 in the UK construction context. Findings Findings from the literature review indicate studies in Industry 4.0 to be a relatively new phenomenon, with developed countries and Germany in particular leading in the field. The range of opportunities are many, but so too are the barriers to enablement. Findings from the case study provide real-world corroboration of the review; practitioners are sanguine about Industry 4.0's potential to reinvigorate the construction industry, but also note that implementation remains curtailed by residual managerial practices dependent on `human interaction'. At present, much of the focus of industry practitioners is on the implementation of building information modelling (BIM), often at the expense of other more advanced technologies within Industry 4.0. Originality/value Research in Industry 4.0 is limited, with the emphasis being on technology application. This paper, by contrast, maps the totality of work carried out so far and presents an assessment of Industry 4.0's progression, potential and degree of uptake within the UK construction industry.},

Although the curve fitting aspect of the solution is empirical, the form of the solution is based on theoretical considerations. Consideration of such factors as pile taper, roughness and shape of the pile surface and volume of the pile, as well as those factors normally considered, differentiates this method from attempts along similar lines. A comparison of computed and observed ultimate bearing capacities reveals good agreement. The method of computation checked with some load tests reported elsewhere shows good correlation. Variations in the factors pile taper, roughness of pile surface, and volume of pile cause significant variations in the ultimate bearing capacity of a pile. For economical design of pile foundations, such factors should be considered.},

We present a BOFDA setup that performs strain measurements with a spatial resolution better than 3 meters over a length of 2 km. Its accuracy is verified by measurements on a calibrated strain profile as well as several laboratory tests that emulate the stressing of the optical fibers by soil movement. It is shown that the BOFDA approach offers feasible solutions to known critical issues of Brillouin sensing such as spectral broadening at high spatial resolution, digital filtering for enhancement of the dynamic range, and fluctuations of the Brillouin gain due to birefringence.},

  abstract = {The glauconitic facies is widespread on present-day continental shelves from 50{$^\circ$} S to 65{$^\circ$} N and at water depths between 50 and 500 m, and is in particularly great abundance on the upper slope and outer shelf between 200 and 300 m. It is also common in many ancient rocks of post-late Precambrian age. It occurs as sand- to pebble-sized, essentially green particles (granular facies) but also as a surface coating on particles and hardgrounds and as a diffuse impregnation (film and diffuse facies). We suggest the replacement of the term `glauconite', which has been interchangeably used to designate a morphological form and a specific mineral, by glaucony (facies) and glauconitic smectite and glauconitic mica as end members of the glauconitic mineral family. The widely accepted model of Burst and Hower for glauconitization requires a degraded, micaceous (2: 1 layer lattice structure) parent clay mineral. However, detailed analysis of numerous samples of Recent glaucony reveals that such a parent substrate is exceptional. The model therefore requires modification. Generally the parent material is carbonate particles, argillaceous (kaolinitic) faecal pellets, infillings of foraminiferal tests, various mineral grains and rock fragments, that pass gradually into the commonly occurring green grains. We show that the process of glauconitization is achieved by de novo authigenic growth of automorphous crystallites in the pores of the substrate, accompanied by progressive alteration and replacement of the substrate. It is this two-fold evolution that causes the `verdissement'of granular substrates, macrofossils and hardgrounds. The authigenic mineral is an iron-rich and potassium-poor glauconitic smectite. While new smectites are growing into the remaining pore space the earlier smectites are modified by incorporation of potassium, producing decreasingly expandable minerals with a non-expandable glauconitic mica as the end member. This mineralogical diversity of the glauconitic mineral family explains the highly variable physical and chemical properties of glaucony. Four categories, nascent, little-evolved, evolved and highly-evolved glaucony are distinguished. Glauconitization appears to be controlled by a delicate balance between degree of physical confinement of a particle and the amount of ionic exchange between the micro-environment and ambient open marine sea water. The optimum conditions for glauconitization are those of semi-confinement. As a result the interior of a grain is more glauconitized than its less confined periphery. Similarly, for identical substrate types, large grains (500{$\mu$}m) provide more favourable substrates for glauconitization than lesser confined small grains. On a larger scale the formation of glaucony is governed by the availability of iron and potassium and the balance between detrital influx and winnowing. Low accumulation rates expose grains to the open marine environment for sufficiently long times (105-106 years for highly-evolved glaucony).},

Although the piles installed by these methods are usually used for retaining walls, there have recently been an increasing number of cases where SP piles and RCP piles are used for foundations. To understand the performance of these piles and establish rational design methods, it is necessary to accumulate load test results with different pile specifications and in different ground conditions. This paper reports the records of installation and the results of static vertical load tests on two piles with the outer diameter of 1000mm and the thickness of 12mm, which were installed by SP or RCP in the same site.},

The data indicate that for anchors with no flukes, expected anchor tip embedment depths are two to three times the anchor length for impact velocities approaching 30 m/s, with a strong dependence on the net density of the anchor and smaller dependence on the impact velocity. Total energy, defined as the sum of the kinetic energy of the anchor at the mudline and the potential energy released as it penetrates the seabed, is shown to be a useful quantity for comparing the embedment depth of anchors with markedly different geometries and mass, impacting the soil at different velocities. The centrifuge data were used to calibrate an analytical embedment model, based on strain-rate-dependent shearing resistance and fluid mechanics drag resistance. The merit of the anchor embedment model has been demonstrated by predicting the final embedment depths for a series of offshore field trials to within 4\% of the measurements.},

The results show a fair approximation between both models in the outcome of the reliability analyses. The stochastic properties of the variables were based on the recommendations of the Joint Committee for Structural Safety (JCSS) and corrosion was also included in the analyses through a probabilistic model.

In the first part, the uncertainties to be considered in foundation design are listed, and their statistics are examined. Additionally, the sensitivities of each uncertainty propagation to the design outcome (performance) are examined, and the perspectives in the narrow sense of structural design are discussed. In the second part, the necessity of evaluating the temporal change of the structural state (structural performance) by reliability updates with additional observations, considering the design of geotechnical structures as the management system of the initial design, construction, and maintenance through a review of research is discussed. Furthermore, the importance of evolving to a more flexible design system, i.e., recalling the original idea of the performance design concept, is indicated.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. This paper documents the use of the Imperial College Pile (ICP) design methods to obtain axial capacity of driven steel pipe piles for nine platforms in the UK North Sea. The diameter, wall thickness and length of the installed piles are based on these methods. The ICP methods have been used in preference to those given by API because they give more reliable values. The paper summarises site soil conditions, compares API and ICP capacities, discusses pile instrumentation data from installations and provides guidance on suitable factors of safety for use with the ICP methods.INTRODUCTION. The pile capacity methods recommended by API have been successfully used to design foundations for offshore structures since the 1960s. The methods have recognised shortcomings and, in order to address these, the methods have been continuously improved and updated with the changes being documented in successive revisions to the published recommended practice, a process that continues to this day.In the early 1980s Shell U.K. Exploration and Production (Shell Expro) identified a need to improve design methods for its offshore structures, especially those relating to pile capacity in dense sand. To that end Shell Expro commissioned a major review of end bearing, for which a summary has been published1, and commenced sponsorship of a joint industry research project at Imperial College into shaft capacity that lasted ten years and culminated in the publication of a design guide2.As a result of this work Shell U.K. Limited (Shell) has not used API RP2A3 pile design methods for platform foundations since 1996, when the Imperial College Pile (ICP) design methods2 were first published. The reason for the change in design practice was because the new methods are based on improved soil models that give better predictability of pile load test results and they have been incorporated into the Company's Standards. The new methods allow Shell to demonstrate the safety of its designs through structural reliability assessments. In certain situations the new methods also result in smaller, more cost effective foundations.This paper summarises the soil conditions and foundations for nine North Sea platforms. It compares axial capacities derived by ICP4 and API RP2A3 methods with results from pile instrumentation that monitored pile-driving stresses during foundation installation. A procedure to assess foundation reliability is also described and target reliabilities are suggested. The results of reliability assessments for the platforms are given and the minimum resistance factors needed to meet the stated targets are tabulated. Shell has also used the ICP design methods to reanalyse the foundations of a number of existing platforms when updating structural assessments or considering additional topside loads, however, these platforms are not covered in this paper.The SitesSeven of the platforms are installed in the UK Southern North Sea (SNS), with the other two being installed in the UK Central North Sea (CNS). The platforms vary from 5 to 30m in plan dimensions and stand in 25 to 120m of water. They are all founded on driven steel pipe piles with diameters},

  abstract = {The majority of the bridges in the historic city centre of Amsterdam are supported by wooden foundation piles. Most of these were constructed 100--300 years ago, currently raising concerns about potential safety issues. The wooden piles under the bridges remain entirely under the water table, potentially subjected to bacterial decay in anaerobic conditions. Bacterial degradation proceeds at a slow rate, allowing the piles to perform their function for many years, although causing a reduction of their load-carrying capacity over time. To this end, a large experimental campaign was conducted to characterize the material and mechanical properties in relation to biological decay of 60 spruce and fir piles, dated back to 1727, 1886 and 1922, retrieved from two bridges in Amsterdam. Large-scale compression tests were carried out on 201 pile-segments extracted from head, middle-part and tip of the piles to determine their remaining short-term compressive strength. Micro-drilling measurements were conducted on each pile and analysed with a TU-Delft-developed algorithm, aimed at determining the soft shell -- the width of the decayed outer layer of the piles' cross section. Micro-drilling allowed to accurately assess the remaining sound cross section of the pile, which resulted to be well correlated to its mechanical properties. The extent of decay throughout the cross-section of the piles was assessed within sapwood and heartwood through experimental models from literature and validated with Computed Tomography (CT) scanning. This allowed to identify that bacterial decay was only present in the non-durable sapwood, even in very degraded piles. Moreover, the soft shell resulted to be rather uniform along the piles' length. The analysis of decay, supported by micro-drilling and CT scans, allowed to develop experimental equations to predict the remaining short-term compressive strength along the pile length. The micro-drilling technique is now used on a large scale in Amsterdam, supporting the assessment of the remaining load carrying-capacity of wooden foundation piles in the city, aiding in the planning of conservation, maintenance and preservation strategies.},

  abstract = {This paper reviews the development of energy harvesting for low-power embedded structural health monitoring (SHM) sensing systems. A statistical pattern recognition paradigm for SHM is first presented and the concept of energy harvesting for embedded sensing systems is addressed with respect to the data acquisition portion of this paradigm. Next, various existing and emerging sensing modalities used for SHM and their respective power requirements are summarized followed by a discussion of SHM sensor network paradigms, power requirements for these networks, and power optimization strategies. Various approaches to energy harvesting and energy storage are discussed and limitations associated with the current technology are addressed. The paper concludes by defining some future research directions that are aimed at transitioning the concept of energy harvesting for embedded SHM sensing systems from laboratory research to field-deployed engineering prototypes. Finally, it is noted that many of the technologies discussed herein are applicable to powering any type of low-power embedded sensing system regardless of the application.},

  abstract = {The compression index is a one of the important soil parameters that is essential to geotechnical designs. As the determination of the compression index from consolidation tests is relatively time-consuming, empirical formulas based on soil parameters can be useful. Over the decades, a number of empirical for- mulas have been proposed to relate the compressibility to other soil parameters, such as the natural water content, liquid limit, plasticity index, specific gravity, and others. Each of the existing empirical for- mulas yields good results for a particular test set, but cannot accurately or reliably predict the compres- sion index from various test sets. In this study, an alternative approach, an artificial neural network (ANN) model, is proposed to estimate the compression index with numerous consolidation test sets. The com- pression index was modeled as a function of seven variables including the natural water content, liquid limit, plastic index, specific gravity, and soil types. Nine hundred and forty-seven consolidation tests for soils sampled at 67 construction sites in the Republic of Korea were used for the training and testing of the ANN model. The predicted results showed that the neural network could provide a better perfor- mance},

Prior to implementation of the framework, resistance factors were calibrated based on the distribution of the measured-to-predicted pile ultimate bearing capacity using the results of static pile load tests conducted to failure. These resistance factors and the distribution were considered to be ``prior.'' The prior distribution of the measured-to-predicted ultimate bearing capacity was updated based on Bayesian theory to incorporate additional proof pile load test results. Using the measured-to-predicted load distributions and the updated (or posterior) measured-to-predicted bearing capacity distributions, resistance factors were calibrated (or updated) from the first-order reliability method (FORM) for two different target reliability indices, 2.33 and 3.0. This research attempted to use the results of proof pile load tests, which are generally conducted to verify pile designs, to update resistance factors. The updated resistance factors varied substantially depending on the proof pile load test results. Therefore, the Bayesian implementation can contribute to economical pile designs.},

The work was developed in the laboratory through a series of model tests a pile installed, in both medium and dense sands, applying downwardly directed vertical water jets. Experimental results have shown that the fluidized geometry is not influenced by soil initial density. During pile installation, the perturbed zone covers a distance of two external diameters from the pile centreline, independent of the applied flow rate. By equating gravitational and upward drag forces on sand particles through Froude number, an expression for the fluidized zone is derived, which is shown to be correlated with fluidization water jet flow rate, as well as the soil and fluid properties. The critical depth of installation of fluidized piles is expressed as a function of the fluidized zone, and it ranges from 15 times the pile diameter until more than 50 times of it, being dependent on the actual combination of fluidized and soil parameters, as well as the pile geometry.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:. Installation predictions for offshore wind monopiles are increasingly challenging as their diameter is increasing due to larger turbines and deeper water depths. Current driveability approaches used by the industry to predict the soil's static resistance to driving (SRD) have proven to be inaccurate since they have been developed based on different soil conditions, hammer, and pile characteristics. This paper proposes an approach for developing a new SRD method which includes the back-analyses of monopile driving records and the statistical evaluation of fitting parameters employed to assess its accuracy. It also explains the process of optimising the methodology across all available driving records and proposing a generic formulation adaptable for different offshore sites. The proposed methodology is dynamic with the option of including more driving records as they become available, thereby increasing the future accuracy and parameter space.1 Introduction. Monopile sizes for offshore wind turbine generators (WTGs) are expected to increase significantly as the offshore WTGs increase in size and output. Transport and installation of ever larger monopiles is becoming increasingly complex and hence reliable installation predictions, harnessing the experience gained from previously installed monopiles, is required.The monopile installation predictions used in the offshore industry currently rely upon the soil's static resistance to driving (SRD). Incorrect SRD input may lead to inaccurate prediction of the monopile driving behaviour with a potential direct impact in the monopile transport \& installation strategy and other important aspects of the monopile design.Studies have shown that SRD methods currently used by the offshore industry are derived based on slender piles and misestimate the actual blow counts needed (Perikleous et al., 2020; Meissl et al. 2023, Stergiou et al., 2023)As monopiles installed by the offshore industry increase in number rapidly, their driving records can be used to develop SRD methodologies tailored to offshore monopiles.This publication is the second of a series of three papers (Meissl et al., 2023; Stergiou et al., 2023) that presents the development of a new SRD methodology for offshore wind monopiles, called MonoDrive. The current paper presents the approach used for the development of the SRD method.},

Coarse-grained soils with glauconite content can potentially increase risks associated with pile installation as glauconitic particles are prone to crushing, leading to an altered soil behaviour whereby there is an increase in the soil static resistance to driving (SRD) which leads to greater driving fatigue and higher potential of pile refusal. This paper discusses the findings from the installation of large monopiles in the North Sea in glauconitic sands. The installation of these monopiles has been studied by analysing the driving records and comparing the driving behaviour to the predictions made with standard SRD methods. The analysis has shown that soil resistance and blow counts are significantly underpredicted with these methods. An approach for better modelling pile driving in glauconitic sands is proposed.},

The scale of this approach was novel at that time and possibly first-ever. The synthetic CPT profiles were derived from a training data set of 122 actual CPTs and ultra-high-resolution (UHR) seismic reflection traces, using machine learning by a convolutional neural network. The synthetic CPT profiles were limited to positions along the 162 UHR survey track lines (2D) and were limited to cone resistance to a depth of 50 m below seafloor. The UHR track lines were spaced at about 400 m. This paper explores upscaling the synthetic CPT approach to voxel (3D) models and adding (S)CPT-based parameters such as shear modulus at small strain Gmax                         . Future added-value is expected from post-2020 improvements seen in seismic reflection data resolution, attribute extraction and neural network architecture.},

  abstract = {The calculated response from a numerical model will deviate from the measured one given the presence of modelling idealizations and real world construction effects. This deviation can be directly captured by a ratio between the measured and the calculated quantity. The ratio is also called a model factor in many design guides. The probabilistic distribution of the model factor is arguably the most common and simplest complete representation of model uncertainty. The characterisation of model uncertainty is identified as one of the critical elements in a geotechnical reliability-based design process in Annex D of ISO 2394:2015 ``General Principles on Reliability of Structures''. This Spotlight paper reviews the databases for various geo-structures and determines their associated model statistics. Foundation load test databases are the most prevalent. A recent effort to compile a large generic database (PILE/2739) that contains 2739 field load tests conducted on various piles and installed in different soils and countries, is highlighted. This systematic compilation of load test data is part of a broader research agenda to digitalise foundation design for ``precision construction'', which is targeted at characterising ``site-specific'' model factors and soil parameters based on both site-specific and generic data for further customisation of design to a particular site. The mean and COV of the model factor for a range of geo-structures, geomaterials, and limit states (both ultimate and serviceability) are summarized in a form suitable for adoption in design and codes of practice. Based on this summary, it is proposed that a model factor for a design model can be classified as: (1)~moderately conservative (1 {$\leq$} mean {$<$} 2), (2) highly conservative (2 {$\leq$} mean {$<$} 3), or (3) very highly conservative (mean {$\geq$} 3). The model uncertainty can be as: (1) low dispersion (COV {$<$} 0.3), (2) medium dispersion (0.3 {$\leq$} COV {$<$} 0.6), (3) high dispersion (0.6 {$\leq$} COV {$<$} 0.9), and (4) very high dispersion (COV {$\geq$} 0.9). This summary represents the most extensive and significant update of Table 3.7.5.1 in the 2006 JCSS Probabilistic Model Code.},

This review paper covers uncertainty quantification (soil properties, stratification, and model performance) and uncertainty calculation with a focus on how it enhances the role of modeling in decision making (reliability analysis, reliability-based design, and inverse analysis). The key output from a reliability analysis is the probability of failure, where ``failure'' is defined as any condition that does not meet a performance criterion or a set of criteria. In contrast to the global factor of safety, the probability of failure respects both mechanics and statistics, is sensitive to data (thus opening one potential pathway to digital transformation), and it is meaningful for both system and component failures. Resilience engineering requires system level analysis. As such, geotechnical software can provide better decision support by computing the probability of failure/reliability index as one basic output in addition to stresses, strains, forces, and displacements. It is further shown that more critical non-classical failure mechanisms can emerge from spatially variable soils that can escape notice if the engineer were to restrict analysis to conventional homogeneous or layered soil profiles.},

The use of a limited number of piles, strategically located, may improve both the ultimate load capacity and the settlement and differential settlement performance of the raft. This paper discusses the philosophy of using piles as settlement reducers and the conditions under which such an approach may be successful. Some of the characteristics of piled raft behaviour are described. The design process for a piled raft can be considered as a three-stage process. The first is a preliminary stage in which the effects of the number of piles on load capacity and settlement are assessed via an approximate analysis. The second is a more detailed examination to assess where piles are required and to obtain some indication of the piling requirements. The third is a detailed design phase in which a more refined analysis is employed to confirm the optimum number and location of the piles, and to obtain essential information for the structural design of the foundation system. The selection of design geotechnical parameters is an essential component of both design stages, and some of the procedures for estimating the necessary parameters are described. Some typical applications of piled rafts are described, including comparisons between computed and measured foundation behaviour.},

In this technical paper, sample disturbance index, using merely the slopes of compression paths, (representing mechanical response), in the pre- and post-yield stress regimes under odeometric loading conditions is proposed. This method is based on single oedometer test results on samples of unknown degrees of disturbance during sampling and handling. The unique feature of this approach is that the ideal rigid plastic material behavior is taken as reference. This eliminates the need for any additional experimental data or any calculations from the relationships formulated with any set of assumptions.},

A variety of axial capacity approaches (IC-05, UWA-05 and Fugro-05) are assessed in unmodified and modified form to appraise their ability to be used in estimating the driveability of open-ended steel piles used to support, for example, offshore jackets or bridge piers. Modifications to the CPT-based design approaches include alterations to the proposed base resistance to account for the resistance mobilized under discrete hammer impacts and the presence of residual stresses, as well as accounting for the effects of static capacity increases over time, namely ageing. Furthermore, a study on the influence of various operational parameters within a wave equation solver is conducted to ascertain the relative impact of uncertain data in this respect. The purpose of the paper is not to suggest a new design procedure for estimating pile driveability, rather to investigate the influence of the various operating parameters in a driveability analysis and how they affect the magnitude of the resulting predictions.

  abstract = {Abstract. Over the last 5 years the CPT (Cone Penetration Test) has become the reference geotechnical tool for assessing burial conditions along pipeline or telecommunication cable routes. At shallow penetrations in sands, the increase of the cone resistance with depth is strongly affected by the low confining pressures due to the overburden. This transitory phase is ignored in traditional CPT interpretation methods.The paper presents a new method for interpreting results obtained from standard cone penetration tests at shallow penetration (less than 3 meters) in saturated marine sands. The method is based on experimental data obtained from a series of laboratory tests in a calibration chamber and a back analysis of hundreds of offshore CPTs performed in water depths ranging from 50 to 2000m and in a large variety of environmental conditions (North Sea, Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean)Introduction. In response to the demand of the telecommunication cable market new tools have been recently developed and introduced for burial assessment purposes which are now available to the pipeline industry. The CPT has become the reference tool for obtaining the geotechnical data required for burial engineering. It is used in conjunction with continuous profiling techniques, e.g., seismic refraction or electrical resistivity. These techniques implemented through bottom-towed sleds provide an accurate stratigraphy of the subsoil over the target burial depth and a quantitative characterization of the materials via their compressive seismic velocity (Vp) or their electrical resistivity (?). A more detailed description of the so-called e\_bass (electronic burial assessment survey) technology can be found in a companion paper to this conference (OTC 14074).Correlating geophysical parameters (Vp, ?) obtained on a continuous basis and geotechnical parameters derived from CPT measurements at discrete locations is the key to data integration and continuous assessment of burial conditions all along the route.Extensive research has been carried out with a view of establishing relationships between CPT data and geophysical or mechanical properties of sands. The main results available concern correlations between:--cone resistance (qc), relative density (Dr) and confining pressure (?'v or ?'m), e.g., Schmertmann (1978), Lunne and Christoffersen (1983), Jamiolkowski et al. (1988);--compressive (Vp) or shear (Vs) wave velocities (alternatively small strain moduli Emax or Gmax), soil density and confining pressure e.g. Hardin (1978), Dobry et al. (XX), Lo Presti and O'Neill (1991).Relations between seismic velocities have been inferred by combining the above two sets of correlations, e.g., Jamiolkowski and Robertson (1988), Foray and Bouguerra (1995) or by direct measurements of both quantities in calibration chamber tests, e.g., Baldi et al. (1989) or Rix and Stokoe (1991).These works have a common limitation due to the fact that experimental data used to establish the correlations were obtained at confining pressures in excess of 50 kPa. Their applicability to low confining pressures (typically less than 30 kPa) representative of the first 2 to 3m of penetration relevant for burial engineering remains questionable.},

Some of the main findings include: (i) partially and fully prefabricated CDFs and conducting DLTs reduced the environmental impact in most categories (by up to 44\% for global warming emissions) compared to the fully cast-in-situ CDFs, although they were 12--37\% more expensive; (ii) changing the compressive strength of the concrete (in piles and cap) in fully cast-in-situ CDFs from 25 to 35\,MPa reduced the environmental impact by up to 14--17\% in all categories and economic costs by up to 12\%; and, (iii) CDFs with bored piles resulted in the lowest environmental burden when designed with Eurocode and UK annexes (11--31\% less impact), as did CDFs with driven piles designed with current Spanish codes (11--18\% less impact). The study variables and sensitivity analysis showed a significant effect on the results and should be considered in future construction, research, and building codes.},

Geotechnical data up to a depth of 50 m from 1053 borehole locations covering almost every district in the state of Haryana have been considered to develop models and statistical correlations. A general trend has been recorded in the observed data and accordingly, the outliers have been excluded. Several models have been developed to establish functional correlations. These correlations have been ranked on the basis their coefficient of determination (R2) value and mean absolute error (MAE). Subsequently, the model with the highest R2 value and minimum mean absolute error has been considered for the development of correlations. Analysis has also been carried out for all the developed models to assess their individual performance. For this purpose, all the developed models have been evaluated by fitting a straight line between observed and modelled values, and in all the cases, a good value of R2 has been observed. The R2 values obtained for all the models range from 0.798 to 0.988. On comparison, it has been observed that the values of geotechnical parameters obtained are in close agreement with the existing work.},

  abstract = {Digital twins are being adopted by increasingly more industries, transforming them and bringing new opportunities. Digital twins provide previously unheard levels of control over physical entities and help to manage complex systems by integrating an array of technologies. Recently, agriculture has seen several technological advancements, but it is still unclear if this community is making an effort to adopt digital twins in its operations. In this work, we employ a mixed-method approach to investigate the added-value of digital twins for agriculture. We examine the extent of digital twin adoption in agriculture, shed light on the concept and the benefits it brings, and provide an application-based roadmap for a more extended adoption. We report a literature review of digital twins in agriculture, covering years 2017-2020. We identify 28 use cases, and compare them with use cases in other disciplines. We compare reported benefits, service categories, and technology readiness levels to assess the level of digital twin adoption in agriculture. We distill the digital twin characteristics that can provide added-value to agriculture from the examined digital twin applications in agriculture and in other disciplines. Then, inspired by digital twin applications in other disciplines, we propose a roadmap for digital twins in agriculture, consisting of examples of growing complexity. We conclude this paper by identifying the distinctive characteristics of agricultural digital twins.},

  abstract = {Fuelled by technological innovations and the growing commitment of countries to reduce their carbon footprint, offshore wind has steadily been gaining ground on non-sustainable sources of energy. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA) [2], it is foreseen that wind will be the principal source of energy in Europe by 2027. However, in an effort to protect the marine environment from sound pollution [1], regulations applicable to offshore wind endeavors have become more stringent. To sustain the growth of the offshore wind sector, more durable installation methods are required. Prolongation of the impact duration has been identified as a suitable method to protect the marine environment from sound pollution [7]. However, the market introduction of this technology is hampered by a lack of understanding of its effects on soil-structure interaction. Therefore, concerns exist on (mono)pile drivability, as well as the performance of the foundation under axial and lateral loads. To address this issue, a series of centrifuge experiments is performed in the centrifuge facility of Delft University of Technology (DUT). The experiments are conducted at 50g acceleration and show the effect of blow prolongation on the drivability of miniature steel, tubular pile (outer diameter, D = 42 mm; wall thickness, t = 2 mm) in dry GEBA sand at 80\% relative density. The blow-prolongation technology that is assessed is IQIP's BLUE Piling (BP) Technology [4]. Details on the actuator used to simulate BP technology in the centrifuge are provided by the work of Quinten et al. (2022) [6]. Prior to dynamic installation, the pile was allowed to settle in into the sample under 1g conditions. Subsequently, an second self-weight penetration phase is initiated by increasing the centrifuge acceleration to 50g, while the ram acts as dead-weight on top of the pile. Following the self-weight penetration phase, the centrifuge is intermittently stopped and reinitiated to (re)set the actuator. The BP ram has a mass of 1.889 kg ram and stroke of 40 mm. The results of the BP experiment are compared against those from centrifuge experiments involving impact hammering (IH), the most widespread method of installation for monopiles in the offshore sector. A detailed description of the actuator, the miniature impact hammer of DUT, is provided by Quinten et al. (2022) [5]. The model pile was pre-embedded at a depth of 50 mm under 1g conditions prior to the dynamic installation phase. The hammer operates at a driving frequency of 10 Hz and is equipped with a ram of 0.140 kg, which is released from a height of 40 mm. Comparison of the results of both experiments, reveals striking differences in the cumulative settlement behavior of the pile as well as the pile stresses. The cumulative pile displacement charts, as shown in Figure 1, show significant differences between the two installation methods. For BP (Figure 1a), a series of 3 single blow experiments was conducted. For IH (Figure 1b), the experiment lasted for a total of 37 consecutive blows. The realized pile set during the experiment is comparable between the two tests. The average normalized displacement equates to 0.5D and 0.03D per blow for BP and IH respectively. The soil level inside the pile cavity was measured following the execution of both experiments. The associated measurements indicated that both piles were driven in a fully coring mode. When considering the prototype pile dimensions and soil conditions, this finding corresponds well with the work of Jardine et al. (2005) [3]. Further differences between IH and BP were observed in terms of (peak) pile stress. The driving forces are reduced from 25 kN for IH to 6 kN for BP, respectively. The driving factor behind this reduction is the decrease in interface stiffness between the ram and the anvil. The latter completely offsets the effects associated with the use of a significantly heavier ram mass in the case of BLUE Piling. When the driving forces are expressed as a percentage of the pile yield limit, aforementioned figures respectively equate to 42\% and 10\%. Extrapolated over the full installation sequence, the latter would contribute to a reduction in the fatigue accumulated during installation.\&nbsp; The results presented here form the first step towards understanding the effect of blow duration soil-structure interaction for blow prolongation technology. For the set of installation parameters and boundary conditions considered in this study, it is shown that the differences in pile installation behavior can be captured using centrifuge modeling. The prolongation of\&nbsp; blow duration results in a significantly different overall installation behavior. When looking at the driving forces, the decrease of the interface stiffness between the ram and anvil produces the anticipated decrease in peak driving force. A sustained physical modeling effort is required to ultimately lay the basis for a predictive installation framework for blow-prolonging technology, which would arguably accelerate its adoption by the industry. The latter should help the reek the associated benefits, particularly in terms of fatigue reduction and sound remediation in the near future.},

Four different criteria were selected to evaluate the ratio of the predicted to measured pile capacities. To Compare the prediction of the pile's bearing capacity, estimation approaches, as well as their accuracy plus efficiency evaluation, the Rank Index (RI) was utilized.

In the early chapters it provides a brief overview of the marine environment, offshore site investigation techniques and interpretation of soil behaviour. It proceeds to cover geotechnical design of piled foundations, shallow foundations and anchoring systems. Three topics are then covered which require a more multi-disciplinary approach: the design of mobile drilling rigs, pipelines and geohazards.  This book serves as a framework for undergraduate and postgraduate courses, and will appeal to professional engineers specialising in the offshore industry.},

  abstract = {Under static loading in compression, open-ended piles may fail in a plugged mode, with the soil plug moving with the pile, or in an unplugged mode, with shear failure occurring between the soil plug and the pile shaft. It may be shown that, under drained loading conditions, the former mode of failure will generally occur, because arching action within the pipe pile leads to high frictional capacity of the plug. However, under faster rates of loading relevant to the offshore environment, the increase in effective stresses within the soil plug is limited and the plug capacity is significantly lower. The Paper presents a simple one-dimensional analysis of the soil plug under partially drained conditions. The analysis has been implemented numerically, and the resulting program used to derive design charts which give the plug capacity as a function of the soil plug parameters and the rate of loading. These design charts are presented in appropriate non-dimensional form, with example calculations included for typical offshore piles in calcareous soil.

  abstract = {Scientific approaches to pile design have advanced enormously in recent decades and yet, still, the most fundamental aspect of pile design---that of estimating the axial capacity---relies heavily upon empirical correlations. Improvements have been made in identifying the processes that occur within the critical zone of soil immediately surrounding the pile, but quantification of the changes in stress and fabric is not straightforward. This paper addresses the degree of confidence we can now place (a) on the conceptual and analytical frameworks for estimating pile capacity, and (b) on the quantitative parameters required to achieve a design. The discussion is restricted to driven piles in clays and siliceous sands, with particular attention given to extrapolating from design approaches derived for closed-ended piles of relatively small diameter to the large-diameter open-ended piles that are used routinely in the offshore industry. From a practical viewpoint, we need design approaches that minimise sensitivity to the estimated pile capacity. This may be achieved partly through a greater reliance on pile load testing, where significant advances have been made in the last decade, but also by adopting design approaches that are focused more on guarding against unacceptable deformation of the complete foundation. Example applications in the paper are drawn both from offshore applications, where current challenges include estimating the axial capacity of ultra-thin-walled, large-diameter caissons, and from onshore applications such as bridge piers and piled raft foundations, where inelastic displacement of the piles is not only acceptable, but often essential for efficient design.},

  abstract = {Soil classification is a means of grouping soils into categories according to a shared set of properties or characteristics that will exhibit similar engineering behaviour under loading. Correctly classifying site conditions is an important, costly, and time-consuming process which needs to be carried out at every building site prior to the commencement of construction or the design of foundation systems. This paper presents a means of automating classification for fine-grained soils, using a feed-forward ANN (Artificial Neural Networks) and CPT (Cone Penetration Test) measurements. Thus representing a significant saving of both time and money streamlining the construction process. 216 pairs of laboratory results and CPT tests were gathered from five locations across Northern Croatia and were used to train, test, and validate the ANN models. The resultant Neural Networks were saved and were subjected to a further external verification using CPT data from the Veliki vrh landslide. A test site, which the model had not previously been exposed to. The neural network approach proved extremely adept at predicting both ESCS (European Soil Classification System) and USCS (Unified Soil Classification System) soil classifications, correctly classifying almost 90\% of soils. While the soils that were incorrectly classified were only partially misclassified. The model was compared to a previously published model, which was compiled using accepted industry standard soil parameter correlations and was shown to be a substantial improvement, in terms of correlation coefficient, absolute average error, and the accuracy of soil classification according to both USCS and ESCS guidelines. The study confirms the functional link between CPT results, the percentage of fine particles FC, the liquid limit wL and the plasticity index IP. As the training database grows in size, the approach should make soil classification cheaper, faster and less labour intensive.},

  abstract = {Traditional slope stability analysis involves predicting the location of the critical slip surface for a given slope and computing a safety factor at that location. However, for some slopes with complicated stratigraphy several distinct critical slip surfaces can exist. Furthermore, the global minimum safety factor in some cases can be less important than potential failure zones when rehabilitating or reinforcing a slope. Existing search techniques used in slope stability analysis cannot find all areas of concern, but instead converge exclusively on the critical slip surface. This paper therefore proposes the use of a holistic multi modal optimisation technique which is able to locate and converge to multiple failure modes simultaneously. The search technique has been demonstrated on a number of benchmark examples using both deterministic and probabilistic analysis to find all possible failure mechanisms, and their respective factors of safety and reliability indices. The results from both the deterministic and probabilistic models show that the search technique is effective in locating the known critical slip surface while also establishing the locations of any other distinct critical slip surfaces within the slope. The approach is of particular relevance for investigating the stability of large slopes with complicated stratigraphy, as these slopes are likely to contain multiple failure mechanisms.},

  abstract = {This study proposes a reliability-based design procedure to evaluate the allowable load for augered cast-in-place (ACIP) piles installed in predominately granular soils based on a prescribed level of reliability at the serviceability limit state. The ultimate limit state (ULS) ACIP pile--specific design model proposed in the companion paper is incorporated into a bivariate hyperbolic load--displacement model capable of describing the variability in the load--displacement relationship for a wide range of pile displacements. Following the approach outlined in the companion paper, distributions with truncated lower-bound capacities are incorporated into the reliability analyses. A lumped load-and-resistance factor is calibrated using a suitable performance function and Monte Carlo simulations. The average and conservative 95\% lower-bound prediction intervals for the calibrated load-and-resistance factor resulting from the simulations are provided. Although unaccounted for in past studies, the slenderness ratio is shown to have significant influence on foundation reliability. Because of the low uncertainty in the proposed ULS pile capacity prediction model, the use of a truncated distribution has moderate influence on foundation reliability.},

  abstract = {A revised Upper Cenozoic stratigraphic framework of the Dutch sector of the North Sea Basin is presented whereby offshore stratigraphic units are integrated or correlated with onshore units. The framework is based on an integrated stratigraphic approach that combines elements of lithostratigraphy, seismostratigraphy and allostratigraphy. Offshore formations are redefined in terms of seismofacies and lithofacies associations, and are differentiated on the basis of common genesis and stratigraphic position. These facies associations represent five major depositional environments, which occur in repetitive successions in the subsurface of the Netherlands: Marine, Coastal, Glacial, Fluvial, and Local Terrestrial. Five conceptual basin-wide bounding discontinuities are identified in the North Sea-Basin that span land and sea. They are represented by both seismostratigraphic and lithostratigraphic unconformities and interpreted as surfaces that formed as a result of North Sea Basin-wide changes in depositional systems. Their formation relates to sea level rise, continental-scale glaciations, and tectonic processes. The bounding discontinuities separate informal allostratigraphic groups of formations that have a grossly uniform geologic setting in common. While the allostratigraphic principles provide a view on the stratigraphy on the largest spatial and temporal scale, the genetic concept facilitates mapping on a local scale.},

However, there is uncertainty over the processes that govern the observed set-up and how they may vary from case to case. This paper evaluates three hypotheses against evidence from updated field test databases and laboratory investigations with highly instrumented and pressurised model piles. Potential influential factors are considered including: pile and sand particle sizes, installation style, access to free water, test conditions and external stress change cycles. Laboratory local stress measurements support the hypothesis that moderation, over time, of the extreme stress distributions developed during installation is a key contributor to capacity growth, while field tests confirm the action of enhanced dilation near the shaft. However, field and laboratory piles show paradoxically different ageing trends. The paper proposes that the fractured but compacted sand shear zone that forms around pile shafts during installation leads to set-up being far more significant with large field driven piles than in model tests.},

However, this can lead to conservative designs. For this reason, in this study, a reliability analysis is carried out with FEM calculations aiming to demonstrate the feasibility of reliability analysis for a dike with an anchored sheet pile wall modelled in the 2D FEM, Plaxis. Sensitivity and reliability analyses were carried out and enabled by coupling the uncertainty package, OpenTURNS and Plaxis. The most relevant (ultimate) limit states concern the anchor, the sheet pile wall, the soil body failure (global instability) and finally the system. The case was used to investigate the applicability of the First Order Reliability Method (FORM) and Directional Sampling (DS) to analysing these limit states. The final goal is to estimate the probability of failure and identify the most important soil properties that affect the behaviour of each component and the system as a whole. The results of this research can be used to assess and optimize the current design procedure for dikes with retaining walls.},

The proposed update acknowledges that soil behavior can vary from sand-like to clay-like and that CPT interpretation to estimate large-strain undrained shear strength changes due to the changing drainage conditions during the CPT.

  abstract = {An initial application of CPT results is to evaluate soil type and soil stratigraphy. One of the more common CPT-based methods to estimate soil type is the chart suggested by Robertson et al (1986) based on cone resistance, qc and friction ratio, Rf. Although newer charts have been developed based on normalized parameters, the simple chart based on qc and Rf is still popular because it is easy to use and can be used in real-time during the CPT. This paper provides an update on the soil behaviour type charts based on basic CPT measurements of qt and fs. and proposes a new soil behaviour index for non-normalized CPT results. The chart by Robertson et al (1986) uses the basic CPT measurements of qc and fs and has 12 soil types, whereas the chart by Robertson (1990) uses normalized parameters and has 9 soil types. The different soil types in each chart have sometimes created some confusion when comparing results. The advantage of the early Robertson et al (1986) chart was that it could be used in real-time to evaluate soil type during and immediately after the CPT, since it only requires the basic CPT measurements. Although the normalized charts of Robertson (1990) are considered more reliable because they use CPT parameters normalized in terms of effective stress, they can only be applied after the CPT during post-processing, since they require information on soil unit weight and groundwater conditions that are not available during the CPT. This paper provides an update to the early Robertson et al (1986) chart using non-normalized CPT results. Zone Soil Behavior Type 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 Sensitive fine grained Organic material Clay Silty Clay to clay Clayey silt to silty clay Sandy silt to clayey silt Silty sand to sandy silt Sand to silty sand Sand Gravelly sand to sand Very stiff fine grained* Sand to clayey sand* * Overconsolidated or cemented Figure 1 SBT chart by Robertson et al (1986) based on CPT cone resistance, qt, and friction ratio, Rf (where Rf = (fs/qt)100\%) 2 SOIL BEHAVIOUR TYPE (SBT) Robertson et al (1986) and Robertson (1990) stressed that the CPT-based charts were predictive of Soil Behaviour Type (SBT), since the cone responds to the in-situ mechanical behavior of the soil and not directly to soil classification criteria based on grain-size distribution and soil plasticity (e.g. Unified Soil Classification System, USCS). Grainsize distribution and Atterberg Limits are measured on disturbed soil samples. Fortunately, soil classification criteria based on grain-size distribution and plasticity often relate reasonably well to in-situ soil behaviour and hence, there is often good agreement between USCS-based classification and CPT-based SBT (e.g. Molle, 2005). However, several examples can be given when differences can arise between USCS-based soil types and CPT-based SBT. For example, a soil with 60\% sand and 40\% fines may be classified as `silty sand' (sand-silt mixtures) or `clayey sand' (sand-clay mixtures) using the USCS. If the fines have high clay content with high plasticity, the soil behaviour may be more controlled by the clay and the CPT-based SBT will reflect this behaviour and will predict a more clay-like behaviour, such as `clayey silt to silty clay' (SBT zone 5, Fig. 1). If the fines were non-plastic, soil behaviour will be controlled more by the sand and the CPT-based SBT would predict a more sand-like soil type, such as `silty sand to sandy silt' (SBT zone 7, Fig 1). Very stiff, heavily overconsolidated finegrained soils tend to behave more like a coarse-grained soil in that they tend to dilate under shear and can have high undrained shear strength compared to their drained strength and can have a CPT-based SBT in either zone 4 or 5 (Fig. 1). Soft saturated low plastic silts tend to behave more like clays in that they have low undrained shear strength and can have a CPT-based SBT in zone 3 (Fig. 1). These few examples illustrate that the CPT-based SBT may not always agree with traditional USCS-based soil types based on samples and that the biggest difference is likely to occur in the mixed soils region (i.e. sand-mixtures \& silt-mixtures). Geotechnical engineers are often more interested in the in-situ soil behaviour than a classification based only on grain-size distribution and plasticity carried out on disturbed samples, although knowledge of both is helpful. In general, the normalized chart (Robertson, 1990) provides more reliable identification of SBT than the non-normalized charts, although when the in-situ vertical effective stress is between 50 kPa to 150 kPa there is often little difference between normalized and non-normalized SBT. The term SBTn will be used to distinguish between normalized and non-normalized SBT. 3 MODIFIED NON-NORMALIZED SBT CHART The early Robertson et al (1986) SBT chart was based on cone resistance, qt (or qc) on a log scale with friction ratio, Rf on a natural scale. Figure 2 provides an update of the chart in terms of dimensionless cone resistance, (qc/pa), where pa = atmospheric pressure (pa = 1 bar = 100 kPa = 0.1 MPa) and Rf (in percent), both on log scales to expand the portion where Rf {$<$} 1\%. The number of soil behaviour types has also been reduced to 9 to match the Robertson (1990) chart. Table 1 summarizes the unification of the 12 (Robertson et al.1986) SBT zones to match the 9 (Robertson, 1990) SBTn zones. Reducing the number of SBT zones in the non-normalized chart allows easier comparison between the normalized and non-normalized SBT's. Table 1 Proposed unification between 12 SBT zones (Robertson et al, 1986) and 9 SBTn zones (Robertson, 1990) SBT zone Robertson et al (1986) SBTn zone Robertson (1990) Proposed common SBT description 1 1 Sensitive fine-grained 2 2 Clay organic soil 3 3 Clays: clay to silty clay 4 \& 5 4 Silt mixtures: clayey silt \& silty clay 6 \& 7 5 Sand mixtures: silty sand to sandy silt 8 6 Sands: clean sands to silty sands 9 \& 10 7 Dense sand to gravelly sand 12 8 Stiff sand to clayey sand* 11 9 Stiff fine-grained* * Overconsolidated or cemented Jefferies and Davies (1993) identified that a Soil Behaviour Type Index, Ic, could represent the SBTn zones in the normalized chart where, Ic is essentially the radius of concentric circles that define the boundaries of soil type. Robertson and Wride, (1998) modified the definition of Ic to apply to the Robertson (1990) Qt -- Fr chart. When the non-normalized SBT chart is presented on log-log scales (Figure 2) the boundaries are also essentially concentric circles and a non-normalized Soil Behaviour Type Index, ISBT can also be defined by: ISBT = [(3.47 log(qc/pa)) + (log Rf + 1.22)] (1) where: qc = CPT cone resistance (or corrected cone resistance, qt) Rf = friction ratio = (fs/qc)100\% fs = CPT sleeve friction The non-normalized SBT index (ISBT) is essentially the same as the normalized SBTn index (Ic) but only uses the basic CPT measurements. In general, the normalized Ic provides more reliable identification of SBT than the non-normalized ISBT, but when the insitu vertical effective stress is between 50 kPa to 150 kPa there is often little difference between normalized and non-normalized SBT.},

  abstract = {While reliability methods have already been widely adopted in civil engineering, the efficiency and robustness of finite element-based reliability assessments of quay walls are still fairly low. In this paper, the reliability indices of structural and geotechnical failure modes of two real-life quay walls are determined by coupling probabilistic methods with finite element models, taking into account a large number of stochastic variables. The reliability indices found are within the range of the targets suggested in the design codes presently in use. Nevertheless, neglecting model uncertainty and correlations between stochastic variables leads to an underestimation of the probability of failure. In addition, low sensitivity factors are found for time-independent variables, such as material properties and model uncertainty. Furthermore, the results are used to reflect on the partial factors used in the original design. Important variables, such as the angle of internal friction, are subjected to a sensitivity analysis in order to illuminate their influence on the reliability index. Port authorities and terminal operators might be able to use the findings of this paper to derive more insight into the reliability of their structures and to optimise their service life and functionality, for example by deepening berths or increasing operational loads.},

  abstract = {Design codes and standards rely on generalised target reliability indices. It is unclear, however, whether these indices are applicable to the specific risk-profile of marine structures. In this study, target reliability indices for quay walls were derived from various risk acceptance criteria, such as economic optimisation, individual risk (IR), societal risk (SR), the life quality index (LQI) and the social and environmental repercussion index (SERI). Important stochastic design variables in quay wall design, such as retaining height, soil strength and material properties, are largely time-independent, whereas other design variables are time-dependent. The extent to which a reliability problem is time variant affects the present value of future failure costs and the associated reliability optimum. A method was therefore developed to determine the influence of time-independent variables on the development of failure probability over time. This method can also be used to evaluate target reliability indices of other civil and geotechnical structures. The target reliability indices obtained for quay walls depend on failure consequences and marginal costs of safety investments. The results were used to elaborate the reliability framework of ISO 2394, and associated reliability levels are proposed for various consequence classes. The insights acquired were used to evaluate the acceptable probability of failure for different types of quay walls.},

Two major challenges are the modelling of corrosion and taking into account the decrease of epistemic uncertainty throughout the quay wall's service life. The main objective of this study is to examine the probability of failure, despite successful past performance, when the quay wall is subject to corrosion and randomly imposed variable loads. The development of the annual failure rate is modelled using crude Monte Carlo and by performing a first-order system reliability analysis. The annual failure rates found for service-proven quay walls vary over time. For those with successful service histories and subject to low corrosion rates, the highest reliability indices are observed in the first year of the service life, whereas with higher corrosion rates the final year prevails. In general, it seems more practical to evaluate reliability on an annual basis rather than over longer time periods, since the latter will introduce an iterative procedure to determine the wall's remaining lifetime. The key findings of this study can be crucial for the lifetime extension of existing quay walls, and presumably also for other service-proven geotechnical structures subject to corrosion.},

The experimental results show a 4{$\cdot$}8 to 5{$\cdot$}5 times increase in anchor capacity as the consolidation condition changes from drained to undrained, driven by a steadily increasing negative excess pore pressure with increasing loading rate. At the highest loading rate, under undrained conditions, the measured maximum negative excess pore pressures reach a steady limit, suggesting the occurrence of cavitation. This increase in anchor capacity with dimensionless velocity is captured using a `backbone curve' interpretation framework that describes the change in capacity between the limiting values of drained and undrained anchor capacity. Calculation of drained anchor capacity is straightforward relative to the more challenging problem of calculating undrained capacity, particularly during cavitation. This was addressed separately through a numerical parametric study (pure undrained analysis) using a bounding surface soil model involving different water depths (cavitation potential), densities and embedment ratios. The numerical results are then synthesised into a simple extended analytical solution to allow estimation of undrained anchor capacity under different densities and water depths.},

The quays were essentially constituted by anchored sheet pile retaining walls in which the main structural elements were steel profiles. Therefore, the main point of concern was the degradation of the steel piles after a long-lasting exposure to the sea water. The corrosion of steel structures in marine environment is a well-recognized problem for maritime engineering, therefore nowadays a relevant part of the designing effort is oriented towards improving the durability and to minimize the cost of maintenance of infrastructures. However, data from real experience are not frequent. This paper presents some results of the inspection carried out on quays in the Ravenna port after an operative life between 21 to 29 years, focusing on the condition of the steel piles. Data include ultrasonic measurements of the thickness and laboratory analyses of steel samples. Although the environmental conditions were not particularly favourable, the results indicate that the degradation of the profiles in the permanently immersed zone was very limited.},

In this study, distributed fibre optic sensing (DFOS) cables, embedded in a pile during concreting, are used to measure the changes in concrete curing temperature profile to infer concrete cover thickness through modelling of heat transfer processes within the concrete and adjacent ground. A field trial was conducted at a high-rise building construction site in London during the construction of a 51 m long test pile. DFOS cables were attached to the reinforcement cage of the pile at four different axial directions to obtain distributed temperature change data along the pile. The monitoring data shows a clear development of concrete hydration temperature with time and the pattern of the change varies due to small changes in concrete cover. A one-dimensional axisymmetric heat transfer finite element (FE) model is used to estimate the pile geometry with depth by back analysing the DFOS data. The results show that the estimated pile diameter varies with depth in the range between 1.40 and 1.56 m for this instrumented pile. This average pile diameter profile compares well to that obtained with the standard Thermal Integrity Profiling (TIP) method. A parametric study is conducted to examine the sensitivity of concrete and soil thermal properties on estimating the pile geometry.},

  abstract = {The Continuous Flight Auger (CFA) piles, also known as Auger Cast In Place piles (ACIP), have a widespread use in the world market of replacement concrete piles. The installation of such piles is generally made by equipment which records several significant installation parameters, as the torque Mt and the axial force N, applied during the auger advancing step. In the auger retrieval stage other parameters that can influence the load-settlement performance of the pile are monitored. The paper presents a case study dealing with the CFA piles adopted as a foundation for a water treatment basin. In the paper first the equations governing the kinematical analysis of the augering and concreting stages of the pile construction are introduced. After the description of the test site with the subsoil conditions and the presentation of a typical sets of parameters recorded during pile installation the results of two pile loading tests to failure are reported. A new approach for determining the depth of the soil layers boundaries, based on the statistical analysis of CPT profiles with depth, is proposed and successfully applied confirming the qualitative geological analysis of the site. A further statistical analysis is carried out to find a robust correlation between the qc of the CPT and the torque Mt needed to screw in depth the auger for pile construction. Finally, virtual CPT profiles generated from the torque Mt recorded during the tested piles installation are used for piles bearing capacity calculations which are compared with the results of pile loading tests. The successful comparison reported in the paper is a first step to validate the proposal to use parameters recorded during augering to calculate and/or to confirm design values of the bearing capacity.},

The study aims to develop a model to estimate and compare emissions at foundation construction and demonstrate its application using two case studies. A process-based quantitative method is established to estimate emissions due to materials, transportation, and equipment usage. The results are analysed under five impact categories including Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Eutrophication Potential, Photochemical Oxidant Formation Potential and Human Toxicity Potential. Analytical Hierarchy Process is employed to obtain weighting factors to assess impact categories under global and local perspectives. Results obtained an average GHG emission of 67\%, 19\% and 14\% from materials, equipment and transportation respectively. This observation signifies the relative higher percentage of emission distribution of equipment and transportation in foundation construction compared to that in the total building construction. Considerable amount of non-GHG emissions such as Nitrous Oxides and Carbon Monoxides were recorded. Global Warming Potential remained the most prominent impact potential from all the perspectives considered, with an overpowering 75\% contribution from global perspective. However, this relative importance is reduced to 33.74\%--34.85\%, with a relative increase in Photochemical Oxidant Formation and Eutrophication Potentials to 32.55\% and 31.92\% at regional and local perspective. Therefore emissions such as Nitrogen Oxides, Carbon Monoxides and Sulphur Dioxide should be given more consideration at the regional and local perspectives. Results also convey that the emission comparison perspective could change the focus of environmental impacts considerably.},

The text describes the different shapes of the penetrometer diagrams obtained from tests in homogeneous cohesionless soil, as well as the significance of the embedment of a pile into the bearing stratum for deep foundation designs. The paper discusses the De Beer theory, Kerisel's theory, and the theory developed at the Delft Laboratory of Soil Mechanics. The laboratory determines the maximum soil pressure and the corresponding embedment of the pile. According to Professor L'Herminier, "the bearing capacity of a pile may be determined...from laboratory tests on soil samples, the other by extrapolating penetrometer data."

  abstract = {ABSTRACT:. Seismic cone penetration test (SCPT) is the dominant in situ testing technique for deriving small strain shear modulus (Gmax) for geotechnical site investigations. Representative and reliable Gmax determinations are particularly important for foundation design for offshore wind energy developments. SCPT data acquired using different systems often exhibit large scatter which increases the level of uncertainty and subsequently negatively impact foundation design. While various standards provide requirements and recommendations, these are not sufficient to ensure repeatability and accuracy of the measurements. A numerical study was performed using 3D finite element modelling of elastic wave propagation to determine the most favourable data processing workflow and interpretation. Uncertainty analysis was undertaken to identify those combinations that return the lowest uncertainties in the determination of Gmax. This paper presents and discusses the results and provides operational and technical recommendations for SCPT acquisition as well as data processing and interpretation.1 Introduction. Understanding of uncertainties associated with the small strain shear modulus (Gmax) of soil is crucial for geotechnical design, especially for laterally loaded offshore wind foundations. By conducting accurate and precise determinations of Gmax, the uncertainty in soil stiffness can be reduced, leading to better optimization of monopile foundations design.Gmax can be derived using various in situ and laboratory tests. The seismic cone penetration test (SCPT) is a cost-effective in situ technique used to derive Gmax In this test, a seismic source at the sea-floor generates seismic waves that propagate through the soil and are recorded by the seismic sensors within the SCPT probe. Shear wave velocities (Vs), over the studied depth interval are calculated from the seismic wave travel times. Gmax can be calculated from the measured Vs and the bulk density of the soil ({$\rho$}) using the following:(Equation)Accurate determinations of Vs is vital as these values are squared in the calculation of Gmax.},

  abstract = {One of the most important statistical parameters in modeling the spatial correlation of soil properties in a random field is the scale of fluctuation (SoF), which is strongly affected by the sampling interval. In this study, the effect of the sampling interval on the SoF in the vertical direction was examined using cone tip resistance (qc) profiles of 70 CPT datasets. The qc data intervals in the vertical directions were 2.5~cm, 5~cm, 10~cm, 20~cm, 40~cm, 80~cm, 160~cm and 320~cm. The direct integration of sample autocorrelation function method with quadratic trend removal was adopted to determine the SoF. Variation of the calculated SoF versus the extended sampling intervals demonstrates that the SoF increases with the increase in the sampling intervals. Results show that the determined SoF values based on the geotechnical data sampling intervals up to 40~cm are presumably more reliable. Limiting the sampling interval will contribute to the preservation of important correlation information of geotechnical site investigation data.},

These projects require the integration of large volumes of geotechnical and geophysical data, which need to be put in a consistent geological context to understand the geological complexity of the site, and its implications for engineering design. In this paper, we present the state-of-the-art development of a data-driven, integrated ground model for the TNW (Ten noorden van de Waddeneilanden) offshore wind site, the Netherlands. The model starts from establishing a detailed seismostratigraphic or structural model, and culminates in a predictive 3D ground model, which contains parameters -- as well as their uncertainty -- relevant for geotechnical engineering and design applications (e.g., foundation design, geohazard assessment, layout design, etc.). The models combine seismic inversion and machine learning techniques to optimize the workflow.},

The underlying mechanisms controlling friction fatigue are poorly understood, with some design methods including an adjustment for the influence of pile diameter while others do not. This paper back calculates the installation resistance of 0.356m to 2m (14in to 78in) diameter open ended piles driven into very dense sands using wave equation analyses. Cone penetration test data are used to link soil properties to installation resistance. The study illustrates consistent interpretation of a variety of case histories of open ended piles driven in very dense sands using newly developed analysis techniques and normalized parameters. Results provide information on methods for incorporating friction fatigue into drivability studies as well as a discussion of mechanisms related to pipe pile installation resistance in sandy soils.}

To provide a more unified analysis framework, this letter couples cyclic stress and cyclic strain based analysis of liquefaction triggering using site-specific correlations between penetration resistance and small strain shear modulus from shear wave velocity using the seismic cone tests. Cyclic strain theory provides a robust lower limit to liquefaction resistance, and analyses indicate that relatively high ratios of small strain stiffness to penetration resistance lead to high liquefaction resistance at relatively low cyclic stress ratios. The increased resistance to liquefaction from relatively high stiffness values is suspected to break down at higher cyclic stress ratios, where liquefaction resistance is controlled by the potential for soil to dilate, which correlates well with effective stress normalised cone tip resistance. The analysis framework is in general agreement with laboratory and field data that are predominantly Holocene in origin; however further validation by a comprehensive lab testing programme is warranted.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT. A method has been developed to predict soil resistance during continuous pile driving in clay based on interpretation of pile installation experience and related soils data in terms of the soil overconsolidation ratio. Soil resistance, obtained from offshore pile driving records using standard wave equation analysis, can be less than or greater than the predicted static pile capacity in normally consolidated and heavily overconsolidated clays, respectively. Analysis of installation data from large diameter pipe piles in soft to hard clays provides an empirical factor for computing soil resistance from the predicted static pile capacity. Values of the factor for six case histories show a consistent relationship with overconsolidation ratio, and this relationship is represented mathematically. The procedure incorporates overconsolidation ratios determined from undrained shear strength and soil index properties. The method for computing soil resistance during driving for a given soil profile based on the static pile capacity and the empirical adjustment factor is described.INTRODUCTION. Drivability of offshore pipe piles is currently predicted by estimating the resistance that a pile-hammer combination can overcome and comparing this with the likely resistance of the foundation soils. The capability of pile-hammer combinations to overcome resistance can be analysed using one-dimensional stress wave theory (Smith, 1962). A logical starting point for assessing the soil resistance is the predicted static axial compressive pile capacity. However, pile installation data indicate that soil resistance during continuous pile driving is less than the predicted static pile capacity in normally consolidated clays (McClelland et aI, 1969; Aurora, 1980; Stockard, 1980), and can exceed the static capacity in heavily overconsolidated clays (McClelland et al, 1969; Fox et al, 1970; Durning and Rennie, 1978). In order to examine the relationship between static pile capacity, the soil resistance mobilised during driving, and the degree of overconsolidation, six installation case histories of large diameter pipe piles in silty and sandy clays were analysed. The results indicate that the overconsolidation ratio of cohesive soils has a significant influence on pile drivability. The paper presents results of this study and a procedure for computing soil resistance during continuous pile driving.STRESS WAVE THEORY. Stress wave theory (Smith, 1962) has been used routinely for many years in offshore pile drivability studies. Nonetheless, uncertainty exists regarding values for some of the numerous parameters used in the mathematical solution. The more important of these variables are the hammer impact energy and the parameters for springs and dashpots that model soil resistance. Hammer input energy is not routinely measured in offshore construction. Conflicting published values for quake and damping, representing the resistance springs and dashpots respectively, indicate an imperfect knowledge of appropriate values for soils. Application of a reasonable range of values for quake and damping for a given soil results in variation by a factor of at least two in the predicted resistance that a given pile-hammer combination can overcome. Variation of hammer efficiency increases the range of predicted resistance.},

  abstract = {There has been consensus on the enhanced geotechnical capacity of displacement piles as compared to nondisplacement piles due the soil improvement effect of the former pile type by virtue of radial displacement along the shaft and pre-loading at the tip of the pile. Many researchers have developed different models over time to estimate the enhancement of geotechnical capacity of partial and full displacement piles. The results of such research have always been reported in terms of revised values for the empirical coefficients used in already existing pile design methods. However, there is a basic lack of evidence in comparison of geotechnical capacities of displacement and non-displacement piles as both types are seldom used on same project and at best the comparison has been made for similar soil conditions in the nearby areas or projects. The objective of present research is thus to compare the geotechnical capacities of various pile types in same soils. Four axial compression load tests were conducted on heavily instrumented piles, one each of drilled cast-in-place (CIP), continuous flight auger (CFA), drill displacement steel pile (DDSP) and drilled displacement (DD) type of same length and similar dimensions installed at one cohesive site in Alberta to eliminate the soil differing and scale effects. The paper evaluates the axial capacities and the load-transfer mechanisms of all four types of piles during axial load tests to assess the increase in geotechnical capacity of the displacement piles in comparison with nondisplacement pile and evaluates the existing design methods adopted for these types of piles.}

For this to occur, significant upscaling of onshore dimensions is required. Furthermore, the effects of certain geometric features on installation requirements are still not well understood. In this work, using the three-dimensional discrete-element method, the effects of base geometry, shaft diameter and helix pitch were investigated by simulating the full installation process prior to conducting axial compression and tension tests. The results of the investigation showed it is possible to optimise the geometry of the screw pile to reduce installation requirements, in terms of both vertical installation force (up to 61\%) and installation torque (up to 39\%), without reducing the axial capacity of the pile significantly.},

  abstract = {Existing guidance on the installation of screw piles suggest that they should be installed in a pitch-matched manner to avoid disturbance to the soil that may have a detrimental effect on the in-service performance of the pile. Recent insights from centrifuge modelling have shown that installing screw piles in this way requires large vertical compressive (or crowd) forces, which is inconsistent with the common assumption that screw piles pull themselves into the ground requiring minimal vertical compressive force. In this paper, through the use of the discrete element method (DEM), the effects of advancement ratio, i.e., the ratio between the vertical displacement per rotation to the geometric pitch of the helix of the screw pile helix, on the installation resistance and in-service capacity of a screw pile is investigated. The findings are further used to assess the applicability of empirical torque capacity correlation factors for large diameter screw piles. The results of the investigation show that it is possible to reduce the required vertical compressive installation force by 96\% by reducing the advancement ratio and that although over-flighting a screw pile can decrease the subsequent compressive capacity, it appears to increase the tensile capacity significantly.},

Drilling velocity ratio, the ratio of rotational velocity to driven velocity, is a critical parameter that affects the driven behaviors of screw piles. Three dimensional discrete element method, with a particle refinement method to enhance computation efficiency, is used to study the driven behaviors of screw piles to compare with the laboratory mini screw pile test results achieved by Shi et al. (Rock Soil Mech 39(6):1981--1990, 2018). The driven behaviors of a mini screw pile (900~mm long and 40~mm shaft diameter) with a variable diameter auger into loose granular assemblies under 0.5, 1 and 1.5 critical drilling velocity ratios are studied. The variation of stress distribution in the assemblies, particle movement around the piles, and evolution of void ratio in the assemblies are investigated. The results indicate that particles around the piles behave differently under different drilling velocity ratios. The reduction of driven force with the increase of drilling velocity ratio can be explained using the direction of particle movement around the piles and the vertical force acting on the screw blades. It was found that under high drilling velocity ratio, higher downward vertical force can be provided by the blades.},

  abstract = {A significant number of large diameter monopiles ({$>$}6 m diameter) have been installed as foundations for offshore wind turbine generators (WTG) across Northern European waters over the past decade, where the self-weight penetration (SWP) during the installation process was recorded. The prediction of the SWP for offshore foundations, such as piles and skirted foundations, is an important installation design task. The prediction of the SWP is subject to great uncertainty, resulting in a large range between lower and upper bound SWP predictions. The methods available to predict the SWP range from simple empirical methods that derive the penetration resistance from cone penetration test (CPT) measurements using skirt and tip resistance coefficients to more advanced methods, based on bearing capacity theory requiring soil strength parameters as input. For the empirical methods, the prediction accuracy is directly dependent on the data used to establish suitable resistance coefficients. Investigating different soil conditions and foundation dimensions (scale effects), therefore, extends and improves the applicability of the empirical SWP prediction methods. This paper will use a portion of the recorded SWP data to benchmark existing SWP prediction methods and to establish improved resistance coefficients for the empirical method using a Monte Carlo type approach. For the Westermost offshore wind farm assessed in this study, the findings show that the existing SWP prediction methods generally under predict the observed SWP. The results of the Monte Carlo type analysis show that the new resistance coefficients are generally lower than the generic resistance coefficients provided by DNV (1992). The results also show that the tip resistance in coarse grained materials and the shaft resistance in fine grained have the largest influence on the accurate prediction of the SWP.},

The practical aspects of consolidation have been considered in several papers in geological and engineering literature. In the present paper we shall be concerned with a quantitative study of the process of consolidation in argillaceous sediments, and the objects of our investigation will be as follows: (1) to examine the compressibility of a number of different types of clay, as demonstrated in laboratory consolidation tests; (2) to present field data on the compressibility of clays in nature; (3) to compare the ture compressibility of clays in nature with that found in the laboratory tests. The first experimental work on consolidation was published by K. Terzaghi in 1921 and 1923. This was collected together and considerably expanded in the book Erdbaumechanik which was published in 1925 and which formed the basis of the new applied science known as soil mechanics. In 1927 the same author gave results of laboratory consolidation tests on several different clays and showed that the compressibility was greater},

However, there are important specific disease-based factors that need to be considered separately. Estimates of prevalence that are based on specific causes of neuropathic pain tend to be lower (1--2\%) than those that are based on reports of the classic symptoms (6--8\%), and further methodological research is needed. All neuropathic pain is associated with poor general health, comparable with other severe chronic diseases.

Methods~The Self-complete Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and Signs (S-LANSS) questionnaire, recently validated for identifying pain of predominantly neuropathic origin, was sent to 6000 adults identified from general practices in the United Kingdom, along with chronic pain identification and severity questions, the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), the Neuropathic Pain Scale, and the SF-36 general health questionnaire.         Results~With a corrected response rate of 52\%, 3 groups of respondents were identified: those without chronic pain (``No Chronic Pain'' group, n=1537); those with chronic pain who were S-LANSS positive indicating the presence of POPNO (``Chronic POPNO'' group, n =241); and those with chronic pain who were S-LANSS negative [``Chronic Pain (non-POPNO)'' group, n=1179]. The chronic POPNO group reported higher pain severity and had significantly poorer scores for all interference items of the BPI than those with chronic pain (non-POPNO). Mean scores from the Neuropathic Pain Scale were also significantly higher for the Chronic POPNO group. There were significant differences between the groups in all domains of the SF-36, with the Chronic POPNO group reporting the worst health. After adjusting for pain severity, age, and sex, the chronic POPNO group was still found to have poorer scores than the other Chronic Pain (non-POPNO) group in all domains of the SF-36 and all interference items in the BPI, indicating poorer health and greater disability.         Discussion~This study confirms the importance of identifying neuropathic pain in the community, and the need for multidimensional management strategies that address all aspects of health.},

In Korea, the importance of liquefaction evaluation is increasing due to lack of damage prediction system by liquefaction and ground amplification when an earthquake occurs. In this study, drilling information was extracted from the 5-1 region of Sejong City, a smart city demonstration area, and ground resistance was calculated to construct a ground resistance model for liquefaction risk assessment. And three - dimensional ground resistance modeling was made by applying GIS analysis technique. Based on this, a digital twin model replicating the same real world environment was constructed to simulate soil resistance. As a result of this study, it was confirmed that the ground resistance result calculated from simulation test was similar to the actual resistance result. It is considered that this can be used for examining the ground supporting force and estimating the ground resistance when an earthquake occurs.},

Differentiation between nociceptive and neuropathic components of CLBP is problematic; evidence suggests that clinicians fail to identify a significant neuropathic component in many CLBP patients. The painDETECT questionnaire (PDQ) was specifically developed to identify occult but significant neuropathic components in individuals thought to have predominantly nociceptive pain. METHODS: Using the PDQ, we classified 50 CLBP patients into two distinct groups; those with predominantly nociceptive pain (Group 1) and those with a significant neuropathic component (Group 2). We characterised these two distinct CLBP sub-groups using a) questionnaire-based behavioural evaluation measuring pain-related function and quality of life, pain intensity and psychological well-being and b) sensory examination, using two-point and tactile threshold discrimination. OBJECTIVE: We sought to determine if differences in the pain phenotype of each CLBP sub-group would be reflected in sensory and behavioural group profiles. RESULTS: We report that Group 1 and Group 2 sub-groups demonstrate unique clinical profiles with significant differences in sensory tactile discrimination thresholds and in a wide range of behavioural domains measuring pain intensity, disability and psychological well-being. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated distinct clinical profiles for CLBP patient sub-groups classified by PDQ. Our results give diagnostic confidence in using the PDQ to characterise two distinct pain phenotypes in a heterogeneous CLBP population.},

These DDS piles are created by rotary drilling with a simultaneous full displacement of the soil in a horizontal direction. The optimal design of DDS piles can be obtained in sandy soils and fine-grained soils that allow for a horizontal displacement, which causes an increase in the shaft's resistance. This article deals with the use of Cavity Expansion Theory (CET) for a complex analysis of DDS piles. This method makes it possible to take into account the impact of the technology in pile design. A general view of the CET is presented and is described step by step for the solution of the present problem. The results of the calculations are compared and analysed with the results of three instrumented static load tests. The analyses include a comparison of the load--settlement curve as well as the load distribution over the pile's length, which was measured using strain gauges. The results of the analyses show very good agreement between the calculations and the measurements. The difference between the calculated and measured load-settlement curves did not exceed a 10\% degree of accuracy. The possibilities for the future use of CET are also discussed.},

Almost 700 monopile driving records have been compiled in a database and back calculated based on standard industry SRD methodologies. A new SRD methodology is developed based on the database which is shown to increase the accuracy of the pile driving predictions by 70\% when compared to existing methodologies.

  abstract = {Abstract. This paper presents case histories of 36 and 42in. diameter piles driven in the Arabian Gulf by hammers with rated energies ranging from 120,000 to 325,000 ft-lbs. Results of hindcast pile drivability studies are presented for sites where hammer performance was monitored using weldable strain gauges to record force-time histories. Procedures for computing the soil resistance during pile driving were determined by correlating field and predicted blow counts. Soil quake and damping parameters for the side and tip of the pi1.e are recommended.Introduction. Wave equation analysis of pile driving is based on the discrete element idealization of the hammerpile- soil system formulated by Smith(l). One of the two major uncertainties in a wave equation analysis is the energy transmitted by the hammer to the pile-soil system. Field measurements have shown that the hammer efficiency is often significantly less than conventionally assumed. Cushion properties may vary significantly during the service life of the cushion. Bongossi hardwood cushions soften with use, as opposed to the stiffening tendency of wire rope. Hammer efficiency, and the stiffness and coefficient of restitution of the cushion were monitored during driving for the case histories presented in this paper. Monitor in hammer performance greatly enhances the value of a correlation study.The soil-pile interaction during driving as described by the load-deformation behavior of the soil at the pile-soil interface and pile point is the other major uncertainty in a wave equation analysis. Smith defined soil-pile interaction in terms of soil quake used in our wave and damping coefficients. These parameters are not intrinsic soil properties, but rather correlation coefficients that incorporate all that is not clearly understood about the process of driving a pile. Some of the data on which previous correlation studies have been based are for small diameter (12 to l8-in.) closed end piles, and may not be applicable to the large diameter open-end piles used offshore. Other studies performed for each driving may not be appropriate for hard driving because blow counts determined by wave equation analysis are insensitive to variations of soil and hammer properties at low blow counts.Despite these uncertainties, wave equation analysis has proven to be a valuable tool for evaluating pile drivability when a data base exists to define hammer and soil properties.Drivability methodology. A pile drivability study consists of three parts. First, the driving resistance that can be overcome by a particular hammer pi1e-soil system is computed from a wave equation analysis. Second, the soil resistance to driving is estimated from soil properties at the site. Third, these results are compared and an evaluation of pile drivability is made that should be tempered by judgment and past experience in the area.The driving records of piles at a particular site often show considerable scatter because of variations in soil conditions, hammer efficiency, and cushion properties. Additional factors affecting drivability are clay setup during interruptions in driving and plug behavior. For these reasons, drivability studies should be used to predict a range in pile driving blow counts.},

Whether instrumented or not, considerable effort can be expended to determine the interpreted failure load developed during the loading test, and the determination of an appropriate capacity is often subject to regulatory review and discussion, which may be complicated by the large number of interpretation methods available and the large range in interpreted capacities that could result. This paper focuses on the differences in the interpreted failure load for augered cast in place (ACIP) piles and seeks to determine which methods are suitable and which methods are inappropriate for the interpretation of ACIP piles. First, a review of various capacity interpretation methods is provided with emphasis on those methods cited in the International Building Code (). Then, an ACIP pile case history database used to illustrate differences in interpreted capacity is described, followed by the presentation of the resulting differences. Recommendations for and against the use of several failure load interpretation methods are made. This paper emphasizes the importance of both the interpretation of the failure load as well as the consequence of a particular methodology on displacement -- a critical performance measure.},

The piles resist the loads of the superstructure and environmental wind and wave forces. Pile running is a major hazard associated with the installation of driven piles in a layered seabed. An analytical method based on Newton's second law of motion is proposed to predict pile running. Two methods are used to calculate the soil resistance to dynamic penetration: (1) the conventional American Petroleum Institute (API) method, where the strain rate dependency and remoulding of the surrounding soil are considered, and (2) the Cone Penetration Test (CPT)-based method, which accounts for friction fatigue. The drag resistance in the context of fluid mechanics has also been considered for pile running. The velocity at the start of pile running was determined by the energy delivered by the piling hammer. A numerical programme was implemented and validated, and then used for three case studies; the results obtained were in good agreement with field measurements. The method presented in this study is dependable for analysing pile running and can provide significant support for pile installation assessment and risk management in offshore engineering design.},

One of the construction issues related to the installation of a LDPP into a seabed is pile running. Unexpected pile running during the LDPP driving process may break the steel wires connected to the heavy hammer or may cause the loss of the hammer into the sea. An analytical method to predict the occurrence of pile running is proposed in this paper. The framework for determining the calculation parameters from a laboratory or field test are established. The dynamic resistance of the surrounding soil during the pile driving process is considered through analysis of the soil sensitivity and the induced excess pore water pressure. Three case studies were conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed method. Good agreement indicated that the proposed method is capable of predicting pile running during the driving process of LDPPs in layered soil deposits.},

  abstract = {Integrity testing of deep cast in situ concrete foundations is challenging due to the intrinsic nature of how these foundations are formed. Several integrity test methods have been developed and are well established, but each of these have strengths and weaknesses. A relatively recent integrity testing method is thermal integrity testing. The fundamental feature is the early age concrete release of heat during curing; anomalies such as voids, necking, bulging and/or soil intrusion inside the concrete body result in local temperature variations. Temperature sensors installed on the reinforcement cage collect detailed temperature data along the entire pile during concrete curing to allow empirical identification of these temperature variations. This article investigates a new approach to the interpretation of the temperature variations from thermal integrity testing of cast in situ concrete piles and presents a field case study of this approach. The approach uses the heat of hydration and heat transfer theory and employs numerical modelling using the finite element method. The finite element model can be customised for different concrete mixes and pile geometries. The predicted temperature profile from the numerical model is then compared, in a systematic manner, to the field test temperature data. Any temperature discrepancies indicate potential anomalies of the pile structure. The proposed new interpretation approach could potentially reduce construction costs and increase the anomaly detection accuracy compared to traditional interpretation methods.},

The test results of the load-settlement curves and unit resistances suggest that standard press-in and rotary cutting press-in pile have similar mechanisms with driven pile. Water-jetting decreases shaft resistance and varies base resistances, and the load-settlement curve resembles that of the bored pile. Finally, the estimated ultimate resistance coincides with the measured ones well, based on the proposed characteristic values. These results can supply basic information to design pile foundations with press-in piling.},

  address = {Perth, Australia},
  abstract = {The Cone Penetration Test (CPT) is the most popular in-situ test for onshore and offshore site investigation. The standard penetration rate employed of 20{\textpm}5 mm/s is well embedded in practice since cone penetration is expected to be fully drained in sand and fully undrained in clay at this velocity. Interpretation of geotechnical parameters from the CPT methods for sand and clay has a relatively high reliability. However this reliability is poor in intermediate soils, such as silts, clayey and sandy silts and residual soils, as penetration takes place under partially drained conditions in these materials. Very little guidance is available to practitioners for derivation of geotechnical parameters during partially drained penetration. This thesis addresses the need for such guidance by examining the rate dependency of penetrometer resistance and consequently also provides information to assist estimation of the penetration resistance and rate dependency of penetrometers with different diameters, such as piles.The Thesis examines the rate dependency of penetrometer resistance using (i) a comprehensive series of penetrometer testing in the field and laboratory and (ii) Finite Element (FE) analyses that simulate penetrometer penetration at various velocities in a range of soils modelled using a non-linear elasto-plastic constitutive model. Interpretation of the experimental penetrometer tests is supported by a series of laboratory element tests on samples of the in-situ soils. The observations made from the experimental and numerical components of this research are combined with the existing database of measurements obtained in previous studies to formulate conclusions.An extensive series of piezocone penetration tests was performed at three sites in Western Australia, to extend the current sparse database of variable rate piezocone tests in the field. Undrained, partially drained and fully drained conditions were observed by performing tests at rates down to 100,000 times slower than the standard rate; variable rate T-bar and ball penetration tests were conducted for comparative purposes. The effect of fines content on CPT end resistance was also examined in a series of variable rate penetration tests on kaolin-sand mixture performed in both the centrifuge and in pressurised chambers at 1g. Laboratory tests on intact and reconstituted samples assisted interpretation of the field and laboratory scale penetrometer tests.A series of parametric numerical analyses was carried out employing the spherical cavity expansion method using the FE code PLAXIS. A coupled consolidation calculation with a non-linear elasto-plastic soil model was used to simulate variable rate cone penetration. These analyses allowed evaluation of the specific effects on penetration resistance of soil stiffness, friction angle, in-situ lateral effective stress, permeability, cone diameter and stress level. Use of a normalisation velocity term incorporating drainage length, horizontal permeability and stiffness are found to be effective to define drainage transitions.The numerical and experimental studies show the velocity range over which conditions can be expected to be partially drained for a standard CPT; this range is defined in terms of a normalised velocity. These studies also show that ratio between drained and undrained penetration resistance is strongly dependent on the soil stiffness and friction angle and hence varies widely with soil type; typical responses for a range of common soil types are identified. Practical recommendations when conducting CPTs in intermediate soils are provided to allow improved derivation of geotechnical parameters.},

This study aims to gain a better understanding of the effect of pile penetration techniques on the variability of bearing capacity. The study uses data from 83 jack-in test piles to explore the variations in penetration resistance at the pile head, base, and shaft. The semivariance increases with an increase of the horizontal distance, so we focus on the semivariance between 5~m range, whose error was defined as the error due to piling workmanship. The analysis shows that the errors follow a lognormal probability distribution, and the coefficient of variation (COV) in penetration resistance at the heads and bases is about 10\%, while the COV in extracted resistance varies widely, with a range of 5--25\%. Little difference in the variations due to piling workmanship was observed among different penetration motions, speeds, and soil types.},

  abstract = {The anchored sheet pile quay wall with a separate pile-supported platform was invented to meet the functional and serviceable requirements of engineering practice, including the higher elevation of retained soils and smaller wall deflection, based on the conventional anchored sheet pile structure. This paper presents the field testing as well as the three-dimensional numerical analysis on the first practical case of the new structure. The performance of the structure and soil is described and discussed, including the lateral deflection, bending moment, axial force, tensile force, and lateral earth pressure. The measured data and computed results show that the lateral deflection of the sheet pile wall can be significantly reduced, and the measured maximum lateral displacement is approximately 0.21\% of the wall height in this case. The bending moment and axial force of the supporting piles are generally greater than those of the sheet pile and anchor wall, indicating that the pile-supported platform is efficient for reducing the loads acting on a sheet pile. The effects of the pile-supported platform can be summarized as a combination of blocking effect of the supporting piles to carry the lateral earth pressures as well as a load-relieving effect of the platform to transfer the vertical loads to deeper foundation soils through the pile. Compared to the numerical results, Coulomb's earth pressure theory significantly overestimates the earth pressure loads acting on the sheet pile at higher elevations. Furthermore, the dredging activity has greater effects on the behaviours of the sheet pile wall and front-pile than the superstructure construction.},

However, there is no systematic way to process these data and knowledge from the engineer and machinist, neither during nor after the installation stage. Aiming to optimize the installation process, a research project was set up jointly with the Dutch industry. The main focus has been to deliver a proof-of-concept of a Bayesian Network that provides an assessment of the installation of each installed pile. The approach had to make use of analysing measurement data during installation, including expert knowledge and interpretation, and other usually unexploited process parameters. In the end, we believe that including these in a decision support system may bring us closer to a robotized installation of piles.},

Skempton's compression index equation correlating the liquid limit, w L , and the compression index, C c , and the reported equation correlating the void ratio at liquid limit, e L , and the void ratio at a vertical pressure of 100 kPa, e 100 , by Burland (1990), were used to establish the e-log p relationships for several reconstituted normally consolidated clayey soils. Consolidation test results of 13 clayey soils covering a sufficiently wide range of liquid limit were selected from the literature. Also, consolidation tests were carried out on two highly expansive soils in this study. A comparison of the experimental consolidation test results with the calculated e-log p relationships in the current study indicated that in general, the agreements between the calculated relationships and the experimental results are good. The agreements were found to be slightly better for soils with liquid limits less than about 70\%. A comparison of the calculated e-log p relationships in the current study with that determined following methods suggested by Nagaraj and Srinivasa Murthy (1983) and Burland (1990) showed that all the three methods yielded very similar results for soils with liquid limit less than 70\%. For soils with liquid limits greater than 70\%, the difference between the e-log p relationships calculated in this study and that following Burland (1990)'s method was insignificant, whereas Nagaraj and Srinivasa Murthy (1983)'s method slightly over-predicted the void ratios at larger vertical stresses. {\copyright} 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

A semi-analytical finite element (SAFE) model for thin cylindrical shells is derived to represent the pile. The linear dynamic response of the soil medium is described by means of Green's functions via the Thin-Layer Method (TLM) coupled with Perfectly Matched Layers (PMLs) to account for the underlying elastic half-space. Furthermore, the non-linear pile--soil interaction is addressed through a history-dependent frictional interface and a visco-elasto-plastic tip reaction model that can be characterized on the basis of standard geotechnical in-situ measurements. The solution to the non-linear dynamic pile--soil interaction problem is based on the sequential application of the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM). The constituent components of the model are first benchmarked against established numerical schemes. Subsequently, model predictions are compared with experimental data collected from field tests. It is demonstrated that the proposed model amalgamates rigorous theoretical elements and promising prediction capabilities in a computationally efficient framework, applicable to engineering practice.},

Dynamic voltage scaling (DVS) has become a promising way for wireless sensor networks to exploit multiple voltage and frequency levels and prolong the sensor node's life. However, pure DVS for embedded systems did not perform well without considering the feature of wireless sensor networks' workloads. This paper proposed a task-driven feedback dynamic voltage scaling algorithm based on the multihop routing and topology changed easily could scale the working frequency and voltage levels dynamically according to the workloads of sensor node, fix the errors through feedback scheme and reduce the node's power consumption at the premise of real-time tasks. The results of simulation indicated that the improved algorithm could effectively reduce almost 30\% more energy consumption than previous dynamic voltage scaling algorithm and prolong the life of wireless sensor networks significantly.},

For geotechnical analyses based on cone penetration test data it is difficult to estimate a representative value of the cone resistance when encountering alternating thin layers of clay or peat and sand. This paper presents physical modelling tests to understand the `value' of the cone resistance in thinly multi-layered soil deposits. The test results are compared with existing analytical methods. It is concluded that the characteristic resistance of the individual layers, the layer thicknesses relative to the cone diameter and the number of layers within the zone of influence of the cone affect the cone resistance in deposits containing multiple thin soil layers. Suggestions for practical implementation are also given.},

  abstract = {Background, Aim and Scope Coastal and river plains are the surfaces of depositional systems, to which sediment input is a parameter of key-importance. Their habitation and economic development usually requires protection with dikes, quays, etc., which are effective in retaining floods but have the side effect of retarding sedimentation in their hinterlands. The flood-protected Dutch lowlands (so-called dike-ring areas) have been sediment-starved for up to about a millennium. In addition to this, peat decomposition and soil compaction, brought about by land drainage, have caused significant land subsidence. Sediment deficiency, defined as the combined effect of sediment-starvation and drainage-induced volume losses, has already been substantial in this area, and it is expected to become urgent in view of the forecasted effects of climate change (sea-level rise, intensified precipitation and run-off). We therefore explore this deficiency, compare it with natural (Holocene) and current human sediment inputs, and discuss it in terms of long-term land-use options. Materials and Methods: We use available 3D geological models to define natural sediment inputs to our study area. Recent progress in large-scale modelling of peat oxidation and compaction enables us to address volume loss associated with these processes. Human sediment inputs are based on published minerals statistics. All results are given as first-order approximations. Results: The current sediment deficit in the diked lowlands of the Netherlands is estimated at 136 {\textpm} 67 million m3/a. About 85\% of this volume is the hypothetical amount of sediment required to keep up with sea-level rise, and 15\% is the effect of land drainage (peat decomposition and compaction). The average Holocene sediment input to our study area (based on a total of 145 km3) is {\textasciitilde}14 million m3/a, and the maximum (millennium-averaged) input {\textasciitilde}26 million m3/a. Historical sediment deficiency has resulted in an unused sediment accommodation space of about 13.3 km3. Net human input of sediment material currently amounts to {\textasciitilde}23 million m3/a. Discussion: As sedimentary processes in the Dutch lowlands have been retarded, the depositional system's natural resilience to sea-level rise is low, and all that is left to cope is human countermeasure. Preserving some sort of status quo with water management solutions may reach its limits in the foreseeable future. The most viable long-term solutions therefore seem a combination of allowing for more water in open country (anything from flood-buffer zones to open water) and raising lands that are to be built up (enabling their lasting protection). As to the latter, doubling or tripling the use of filling sand in a planned and sustained effort may resolve up to one half of the Dutch sediment deficiency problems in about a century. Conclusions: Conclusions, Recommendations and Perspectives. We conclude that sediment deficiency -- past, present and future -- challenges the sustainable habitation of the Dutch lowlands. In order to explore possible solutions, we recommend the development of long-term scenarios for the changing lowland physiography, that include the effects of Global Change, compensation measures, costs and benefits, and the implications for long-term land-use options.

For offshore renewables in shallow water depths, the sub-surface is often highly complex, due to the various large-scale geological processes that have affected these areas over the last millions of years. The result is that spatial variability is a key aspect to address over the entire workflow, from geophysical and geotechnical data acquisition, processing, analysis, geostatistics and ultimately engineering design. The direct consequence is that the site has to be assessed in full 3D, which is rarely adopted for engineering applications on large scale. The data-driven approach exploits the benefits of the geological, geophysical and geotechnical data and integrates those into a consistent ground model. In this paper, we illustrate a number of ground model approaches -- with variable levels of complexity -- and present a few novel methods that will further enhance these models in the future.},

The identification and quantification of any concealed safety factor is a possible way of preventing the reduction of the pile capacity factors that could follow from the test results at least in part. This paper presents the results of a study of concealed safety factors. The conclusion of the study is that it is useful to examine time effects in greater detail, primarily focusing on the quantification of the effect and the determination of the impact of load variations. It is recommended to continue with research into the impact of compaction on pile-base capacity in combination with the sequencing of installation of displacement piles.},

  abstract = {Current methods for characterizing near-surface marine sediments rely on extensive coring/pene-trometer testing and correlation to seismic facies. Little quantitative information is regularly derived from geophysical data beyond qualitative inferences of sediment characteristics based on seismic facies architecture. Even these fundamental seismostratigraphic interpretations can be difficult to correlate with lithostratigraphic data due to inaccuracies in the time-to-depth conversion of geophysical data and potential loss and/or compression of high-porosity and under-consolidated sea-floor material during direct sampling. To complicate matters further, when quantitative information is derived from marine geophysical data, it often describes the sediments using terminology (e.g., acoustic impedance and seismic quality factor) that is impenetrable to geologists and engineers. In contrast, for hydrocarbon prospecting, reservoir characterization using quantitative inversion of geophysical data has developed enormously over the past 20 years or more. Impedance and amplitude-versus-angle inversion techniques are now commonplace, whereas computationally expensive waveform inversions are gaining traction, and there is a well-developed interface between these geophysical and reservoir engineering fields via rock physics. In this paper, we collate and review the different published inversion methods for high-resolution geophysical data. Using several case study examples spanning a broad range of depositional environments, we assess the current state of the art in remote characterization of shallow sediments from a multidisciplinary viewpoint, encompassing geophysical, geological, and geotechnical angles. By identifying the key parameters used to characterize the subsurface, a framework is developed whereby geological, geotechnical, and geophysical characterizations of the subsurface can be related in a less subjective manner. As part of this, we examine the sensitivity of commonly derived acoustic properties (e.g., acoustic impedance and seismic quality factor) to more fundamentally important soil properties (e.g., lithology, pore pressure, gas saturation, and undrained shear strength), thereby facilitating better integration between geological, geotechnical, and geophysical data for improved mapping of sediment properties. Ultimately, we present a number of ideas for future research activities in this field.},

From the tip resistance qc and sleeve resistance fs profiles, the Soil Behavior Type index ISBT has been calculated, in order to identify the lithotypes alongside depth. The present study focuses on the combination of different variables to provide a lithological and mechanical subsoil characterization. The main objectives of the paper are: (1) to model the 3D spatial variability structure of the soil lithotypes and mechanical properties using qc and fs profiles; 2) to evaluate the uncertainties of the estimates for designing purposes. 182 CPTs were collected in a 900\,km2 area (corresponding to a subsoil volume of about 12\,km3) located in the study site in the Bologna province (Italy). The study area is made up of fine-grained soils, silt and clay mixtures that are intercalated at different depths by sandy and gravelly soils. These variations of each soil fraction affect the engineering properties of these alluvial deposits. For 3D modeling, two geostatistical methods, Ordinary Kriging (stationary method), and Intrinsic Random Function theory (non-stationary method) have been used. The results show that the non-stationary method allows to obtain more reliable qc and fs predicted values. The final stochastic mechanical and lithological model enables engineers and geologists to detect the emerging of fan and paleochannels bodies where mean resistance values can abruptly change in terms of bearing capacity, liquefaction potential and static and dynamic settlement occurrence.},

Although several attempts have been made in the past to correlate compression index with index properties as well as initial state parameters of soils, most of the studies are confined to fine-grained soils of low to medium plasticity. This paper presents the results of a study made to characterize the compressibility behaviour of a remoulded, highly plastic, marine soil. The odeometer tests carried out on eighteen samples of this soil indicate that e-log p relationship is linear, the values of compression index being much higher than the reported values. Rigorous statistical analysis of the results obtained has shown that shrinkage index, which is the numerical difference between liquid limit and shrinkage limit, is the most suitable parameter to characterize the compressibility of highly plastic soils. Using the results obtained in the present study as well as those reported in the literature, a generalized compression index equation applicable to soils with a very wide range of plasticity characteristics is also proposed.},

  abstract = {This study presents the geogenetic approach to detect presently drowned archaeological sites in the transgressive palaeoenvironment of the Holocene Rhine-Meuse delta. A staged and practical approach is advocated in which subsurface archaeological predictions are based on geological mapping and palaeoenvironmental reconstruction of the underwater location. The study area is located in the Maasvlakte harbour extension of the Port of Rotterdam, formerly a part of the southern North Sea. Prior to construction works, it was suggested that dredging of the new harbour (Yangtzehaven) would disturb the subsurface stratigraphy to around~-21~m below present mean sea level, a zone which is known to contain archaeological remains. The staged approach makes use of geological data starting from a conceptual model that indicates the depths of layers that could be rich in Upper Palaeolithic/early Mesolithic artefacts. This initial model is used to determine the strategy of the subsequent phases of investigation, such as whether to proceed with dredging as part of the engineering work, down to 17~m water depth, to remove the upper (younger) sands and thereby improve the opportunities for underwater survey of fluvio-deltaic layers of Mesolithic age. Following the development of the initial site model, a full-area investigation was carried out using geophysics and coring, the latter providing material for palaeoenvironmental analysis. This allowed the reconstruction of the long-drowned former landscape, which included inland dune areas and local drainage systems and provided the physiographic context for the geoprospection of Mesolithic archeology. This predictive modeling identified two areas in the harbour for detailed investigation, again employing geophysics and coring at higher resolutions, allowing fine tuning of the palaeolandscape models at the localities of presumed highest archeological potential. Cores from one of the selected areas, an inland dune area within the Early Holocene wetland region, yielded in-situ evidence of Mesolithic occupation of this site in what is now the southern North Sea. These finds and the palaeolandscape context created with the data from the prospection phases were critical in the decision to undertake an underwater archaeological excavation using a large, boat-mounted grab sampling system. This paper provides an account of the geological and palaeoenvironmental work undertaken in the prospective phases leading up to the discovery of the site, highlighting the importance of the staged geogenetic approach for informing sampling strategies and securing high-quality information on landscape contexts, which in turn, informed archaeological decision-making and geoprospection strategies. Such an approach has wider generic application for palaeolandscape reconstruction and mapping at regional scales.},

  abstract = {This is a major release from 0.4. Highlights include new functions for plotting heatmaps, possibly while applying clustering algorithms to discover structured relationships. These functions are complemented by new custom colormap functions and a full set of IPython widgets that allow interactive selection of colormap parameters. The palette tutorial has been rewritten to cover these new tools and more generally provide guidance on how to use color in visualizations. There are also a number of smaller changes and bugfixes. Plotting functions Added the heatmap function for visualizing a matrix of data by color-encoding the values. See the docs for more information. Added the clustermap function for clustering and visualizing a matrix of data, with options to label individual rows and columns by colors. See the docs for more information. This work was lead by Olga Botvinnik. lmplot and pairplot get a new keyword argument, markers. This can be a single kind of marker or a list of different markers for each level of the hue variable. Using different markers for different hues should let plots be more comprehensible when reproduced to black-and-white (i.e. when printed). See the github pull request for examples. More generally, there is a new keyword argument in FacetGrid and PairGrid, hue\_kws. This similarly lets plot aesthetics vary across the levels of the hue variable, but more flexibily. hue\_kws should be a dictionary that maps the name of keyword arguments to lists of values that are as long as the number of levels of the hue variable. The argument subplot\_kws has been added to FacetGrid. This allows for faceted plots with custom projections, including maps with Cartopy. Color palettes Added two new functions to create custom color palettes. For sequential palettes, you can use the light\_palette function, which takes a seed color and creates a ramp from a very light, desaturated variant of it. For diverging palettes, you can use the diverging\_palette function to create a balanced ramp between two endpoints to a light or dark midpoint. See the palette tutorial {$<$}palette\_tutorial{$>$} for more information. Added the ability to specify the seed color for light\_palette and dark\_palette as a tuple of husl or hls space values or as a named xkcd color. The interpretation of the seed color is now provided by the new input parameter to these functions. Added several new interactive palette widgets: choose\_colorbrewer\_palette, choose\_light\_palette, choose\_dark\_palette, and choose\_diverging\_palette. For consistency, renamed the cubehelix widget to choose\_cubehelix\_palette (and fixed a bug where the cubehelix palette was reversed). These functions also now return either a color palette list or a matplotlib colormap when called, and that object will be live-updated as you play with the widget. This should make it easy to iterate over a plot until you find a good representation for the data. See the Github pull request or this notebook (download it to use the widgets) for more information. Overhauled the color palette tutorial to organize the discussion by class of color palette and provide more motivation behind the various choices one might make when choosing colors for their data. Bug fixes Fixed a bug in PairGrid that gave incorrect results (or a crash) when the input DataFrame has a non-default index. Fixed a bug in PairGrid where passing columns with a date-like datatype raised an exception. Fixed a bug where lmplot would show a legend when the hue variable was also used on either the rows or columns (making the legend redundant). Worked around a matplotlib bug that was forcing outliers in boxplot to appear as blue. kdeplot now accepts pandas Series for the data and data2 arguments. Using a non-default correlation method in corrplot now implies sig\_stars=False as the permutation test used to significance values for the correlations uses a pearson metric. Removed pdf.fonttype from the style definitions, as the value used in version 0.4 resulted in very large PDF files.},

The aim is to establish the origin of low reported values of qb/qc which contrast with continuum models that suggest qb = qc for steady deep penetration. Partial embedment of the pile tip into a hard layer underlying weak material has been accounted for by weighting qc. Partial mobilisation has been accounted for by defining failure according to a plunging criterion. When these two mechanisms are considered, the resulting values of qb/qc have a mean value of 0{$\cdot$}90 and show no trend with pile diameter. The remaining slight underprediction of the `continuum' model (qb = qc) could be attributed to the underestimation of plunging load in pile tests for which steady penetration is not reached. This exercise makes two contributions: first, it is suggested that any reduction of qc when estimating the end bearing capacity of closed-ended piles in sand should be linked to partial embedment and partial mobilisation, rather than absolute diameter; second, the dearth of high-quality pile load test data in the public domain is highlighted.},

A series of plane-strain calibration chamber tests has been conducted in order to quantify the penetration mechanism around the pile tip, and the response of the interface layer adjacent to the shaft during further penetration. A series of eight tests is reported, examining the influence of soil type, initial state, pile breadth and the use of a driving shoe. A novel image-based deformation measurement technique has been used to observe the displacement and strain paths, which are found to be relatively independent of soil type. The measured strain paths are similar to predictions made by the strain path method, and contrast sharply with assumptions implicit in cavity expansion solutions. An interface zone adjacent to the pile shaft comprising fine broken soil particles was observed to contract while shearing along the pile--soil interface. This mechanism offers an explanation for the degradation of shaft friction at a given soil horizon with increased pile penetration (`friction fatigue'), and a subsequent recovery of capacity over time (`set-up').},

  abstract = {Free Fall Penetrometer (FFP) tests provide an efficient way to determine the penetration resistance at shallow depths in sandy soils, and are being used increasingly in geotechnical, geomorphological and coastal engineering applications. A limitation of free fall penetrometers is the effect of their high velocity on the penetration resistance. This affects the drainage condition, creates a viscous-type enhancement of the mobilised strength, and also introduces inertial drag forces. It is useful if the measured FFP resistance can be adjusted back to the resistance that would be expected in a standard Cone Penetrometer Test (CPT) at the same location. With this adjustment, the resistance can be used in the same correlations and design methods as standard CPT data. Adjustments for viscous-type rate effects and inertial drag have been proposed and explored in detail for clay soils. The contribution of this paper is to outline a correction scheme for drainage condition, which is more relevant for sandy soils. This correction utilizes the dissipation response at the end of the FFP test, in combination with the measured or derived FFP tip resistance. Relationships for penetration resistance in drained and undrained conditions based on density state are developed. It is shown that the high velocity FFP resistance can be uniquely mapped to a resistance from a standard CPT, when combined with the dissipation response. With development and validation, this new framework could enhance the value of FFPs as a complementary or alternative technology alongside conventional static penetration testing.},

This phenomenon, which is now commonly referred to as friction fatigue, is investigated here using centrifuge model piles equipped with lateral stress sensors, and by drawing on other experimental data from the laboratory and the field. It is shown that the primary mechanism controlling friction fatigue is the cyclic history imparted during pile installation to soil elements at the pile--sand interface. For a given installation method the stationary lateral stress acting at any given level on a displacement pile can be described as a relatively unique function of the cone penetration test end resistance and the number of cycles imposed during installation. The strong influence of cycling, which is also seen in cyclic constant normal stiffness interface shear tests, is attributed to contraction of a narrow shear zone at the shaft--soil interface that is surrounded by soil with a relatively high lateral stiffness.},

  abstract = {An investigation into the behaviour of pressed-in piles has been conducted. The press-in method of pile installation allows large pre-formed foundation piles to be constructed without the noise and vibration associated with conventional dynamic techniques, and with minimal requirement for temporary works. This investigation is divided into two parts; a fundamental study of the mechanics of press-in pile installation in sand and a sequence of field tests to examine the behaviour of pressed-in piles at full scale.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}The mechanics of pile installation have been studied using a plane strain calibration chamber. A new system for deformation measurement in plane strain modelling and other forms of geotechnical testing has been developed. This system combines techniques of digital photography, Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and close range photogrammetry. A series of validation experiments demonstrated that the system offers greater accuracy and precision than existing measurement techniques. This improved performance is achieved concurrent with an order-of-magnitude increase in the number of measurement points that can be established within the observed soil.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}A series of 8 calibration chamber tests is reported. The pattern of soil displacement during pile installation was measured. These measurements were of sufficient quality to allow soil strain paths during installation to be calculated. The influence of soil type and initial density was examined, and the post-installation strain distribution was found. The concentration of shear and volumetric strain close to the pile tip was quantified, and a reversal of strain direction as the soil passes around the pile shoulder was observed.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}A zone of highly compacted soil was observed immediately below the pile tip and along the pile shaft. Contraction of this sleeve of broken soil grains was observed with continued penetration of the pile. A mechanism is proposed to link this kinematic observation to the distribution of shaft friction close to the tip of displacement piles. {$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}A further mechanism is proposed to predict the distribution of external shaft friction along the upper part of a pile shaft. This mechanism is based on vertical arching theory, and is an extension of a previous approach for the prediction of internal shaft friction.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}Four series of field tests using pressed-in piles were conducted. The first series demonstrated that internal shaft friction is well predicted by vertical arching theory. Since vertical arching evolves according to an exponential function, pile performance can be dramatically influenced by only small changes to the governing parameters. The improvement of driveability using an internal driving shoe was investigated.{$<$}br/{$><$}br/{$>$}The final series of load tests demonstrated a novel foundation solution in which the high shaft friction created by vertical arching can be `switched on' after installation. This is achieved using a construction sequence involving H-section piles. During press-in installation of each pile, the geometry does not create vertical arching. During loading of the entire structure, arching occurs. This leads to a high positive group effect, and an efficient foundation structure.{$<$}br/{$>$}},

  abstract = {Three-dimensional (3D) geotechnical site stratification is of vital importance in geotechnical practice. In this study, a set of methods for 3D site stratification based on CPTu measurements of New Zealand Geotechnical Database (NZGD) sites is proposed. One-dimensional (1D) soil stratification at discrete CPTu points is first conducted and then interpolated in 3D to achieve 3D site stratification. 1D soil stratification is achieved through a proposed soil classification model combined with a proposed soil layer boundary identification method, which achieves a correct soil profile length identification rate of 93\%. The soil classification machine learning model classifies the soil within NZGD into three types, i.e. Gravel, Sand, and Silt, and is able to reflect the fines content for silty sand. The model innovatively incorporates local variation information of CPTu curves in the input for a random forest algorithm to significantly improve identification accuracy to over 90\%. Accurately locating soil layer boundaries is achieved through proposing a modified WTMM boundary identification method. 3D site stratification is then realized through 3D interpolation of 1D stratification at discrete CPTu points using a generalized regression neural network (GRNN) method. The 3D site stratification method is validated for two independent geotechnical sites within NZGD, exhibiting the effectiveness of the proposed set of methods.},

  abstract = {As an innovative information technology, Digital Twin has greatly promoted the development of intelligent manufacturing in the industry. However, in the field of geotechnical engineering, there are still few researches on this aspect, which is still a ``new territory'' and ``no man's land''. The concept of digital twin coincides with the needs of geotechnical engineering informatization, so the introduction of digital twin technology into the field of geotechnical engineering will help to promote the development process of geotechnical engineering informatization and digitization. This paper puts forward and defines the digital twin model of geotechnical engineering, describes the connotation of the digital twin model, and studies the architecture of the digital twin model of geotechnical engineering. On this basis, the integration and sharing mechanism of geotechnical engineering digital twin data based on BIM technology is proposed. In order to break through the defect that the geotechnical engineering information model has not fully played its role for a long time, an integrated model of geological body and structural body is constructed based on the construction and integration module of geotechnical digital twin model. Furthermore, the geotechnical engineering digital twin simulation analysis module is developed to initially form the geotechnical engineering digital twin model, so as to realize the geotechnical engineering digital design, collaborative construction, visual decision-making and transparent management.},

Volume properties and pavement performances of SMA mixture with steel slag were also evaluated as compared to that with basalt as aggregates. Results indicated that volume properties of SMA mixture with steel slag satisfied the related specifications and expansion rate was below 1\% after 7 days. When compared with basalt, high temperature property and the resistance to low temperature cracking of SMA mixture were improved by using steel slag as aggregate.

Grain crushing is affected by fundamental soil characteristics, such as their mineral strength, grain size and distribution, grain shape, density and specimen size, and also by external factors including stress magnitude and path, loading rate and duration, degree of saturation, temperature and geochemical environment. Crushable material becomes a series of different materials with the change in its grading during grain crushing, resulting in a decrease in strength and dilatancy and an increase in compressibility. Effects of grain crushing on strength, dilatancy, deformation and failure mechanisms have been extensively investigated through laboratory testing, discrete element method (DEM) modelling, Weibull statistics, and constitutive modelling within the framework of the extended crushing-dependent critical state theory or the energy-based theory. Eleven papers summarized in this review article for this special issue addressed the above issues in grain crushing through the advanced testing and modelling.},

  abstract = {Geotechnical and geophysical testing data are conventionally considered as separated information or combined based on deterministic methods in site investigation programs, which causes loss of information and introduces additional uncertainties. This study aims to reduce the uncertainties and costs in inhomogeneous soil profile characterization and geotechnical analysis by quantitatively integrating these data. The intrinsic collocated co-kriging method (ICCK) is utilized to integrate Multi-channel analysis surface wave (MASW) and CPT data. This research shows the potential of using the MASW data to explore the horizontal scale of fluctuation (SOF) of the cone tip resistance (qc) field which is very difficult to get using the conventional methods due to the limited CPTs. The Markov model is used to avoid the tedious modeling of the cross-covariance relationship in the ICCK method. A series of synthetic case studies show that the combined soil profile is in good agreement with the ``true'' qc field with significantly reduced uncertainties. Based on estimating the uncertainties, the optimal distance between CPTs is suggested to be 1--2 horizontal SOF. This framework is also applied to a real case in the Christchurch area, which involves integration of CPTs and MASW tests. Cross validation and edge detection methods are used to quantitatively compare the integration results, confirming that the proposed framework is fully applicable to field data and can provide realistic and reliable estimations of qc field.},

It is demonstrated that the formulations given by one of these methods, referred to as UWA-05, provides better predictions than the three other CPT methods when tested against (i) an existing database of base-capacity measurements, (ii) results from a new series of load tests on small-diameter piles, and (iii) base capacities measured in two recently conducted load tests on 1.5~m diameter pipe piles. It is shown that the UWA-05 has better predictive performance (and hence reliability) as it accounts explicitly for the effects of partial plugging during pipe--pile installation and for variations in CPT resistance in the vicinity of the pile tip.},

The investigation involved a series of numerical analyses that idealise pile/cone penetration assuming the spherical cavity expansion analogue. It is shown how the end resistance mobilised by a penetrometer in a dense sand (i.e. strong soil) varies with the number of penetrometer diameters (D) from a weak soil (assumed here to be either a loose sand or soft clay), and depends on the ratio of the steady-state penetration resistances of the strong and weak layers. The penetrometer resistance in the weak soil is not affected by an adjacent strong layer at penetrations greater than 2D. A design procedure based on a numerical parametric study is proposed, and this is subsequently shown to compare well with centrifuge test data and with previous numerical research.},

  abstract = {Significant forces can be applied to embedded pipelines in sloping grounds due to soil instabilities, which potentially might lead to leakage of hazardous fluids into the environment. The soil-pipeline interaction in sandy slopes has been investigated experimentally using small-scale physical models tested in geotechnical centrifuge. A novel method is developed in this paper to estimate the ultimate external forces, induced by slope failures, acting on buried pipes at various locations inside the slope. Instabilities were triggered by surcharge loading on the slope crest in the centrifuge tests. Six dense coarse sandy slopes were tested with different pipe locations with respect to the slope crest. Moreover, two medium dense fine sand slopes were tested in the same manner to study the effect of the grain size distribution on the soil-pipe interaction. The external forces on the pipe induced by the surrounding soil movements were calculated based on the measurements of four strain gauges installed on the pipe. The shape of failure surface and pipe movements were monitored with the aid of advanced image analysis techniques. The results indicate that a buried pipeline has the potential to affect the slope failure mechanism. Normalised force-pipe displacement relationships were derived and compared to the estimation methods suggested in previous studies, which were mainly done on pipes installed in flat grounds. A new prediction method is introduced in this study, which considers the pipe burial distance to the slope crest. Moreover, the slope angle effect on the ultimate force applied to the pipe is also investigated, and a generalised formula is developed. Finally, two examples of the application of the new method are presented for pipelines installed at the toe of two large-scale subarial and submarine slopes.},

This paper evaluates the spatial variability characteristics of as-built and estimated founding depths of driven steel H piles with reference to the spatial variability characteristics of geologic profiles at a weathered soil site in Hong Kong. Spatial variability characteristics are evaluated in terms of variance and scale of fluctuation. The variability of three founding depth indicators, i.e., the depth of Grade-III bedrock, the depth of standard penetration test blow count ``N'' of 200 blows/0.3 m ͑SPT-200͒, and the depth of completely decomposed granite over the site was estimated. It is found that pile founding depths exhibit greater variations than those of the geologic profiles due to the presence of design model errors, judgment errors, and construction effects. The as-built founding depths are mostly between the SPT-200 profile and the Grade-III bedrock profile. The variances of as-built pile length are similar to those with depth of SPT-200 but less than those with depth of Grade-III bedrock. The scale of fluctuation of as-built pile length is on the order of 20 m when kriging is used and 10 m when kriging is not used, which are less than those with depths of SPT-200 and Grade-III bedrock.},

  abstract = {Spatially varying two dimensional (2D) geo-data are commonly encountered in earth sciences and engineering, such as soil or rock properties. Only sparse measurements are usually taken on the spatially varying quantity of interest due to resource or time constraints, although high resolution data are generally preferred in an analysis. Interpretation of spatially varying geo-data from sparse measurements is frequently carried out using interpolation techniques, such as kriging in geostatistics. However, when the number of measurement data is too small, the geostatistical methods are not applicable. This hence poses a great challenge for interpretation of the spatially varying geo-data when only sparse measurements are available. In addition, there exists an important question of how to quantify properly the statistical uncertainty in the interpreted results from the sparse measurements. The statistical uncertainty may greatly influence subsequent engineering design or analysis. To address the two challenges mentioned above, a 2D Bayesian compressive sampling (2D BCS) approach is developed in this study. The 2D BCS approach not only provides a best estimate of the spatially varying 2D surface but also explicitly quantifies the statistical uncertainty associated with the interpretation. The quantified statistical uncertainty may be used as an index to evaluate the reliability and quality of the 2D BCS interpretation results. Both simulated and real-life data are used to illustrate and validate the proposed approach. The proposed 2D BCS approach is shown to properly interpret spatially varying 2D data from sparsely measured data and quantify explicitly the statistical uncertainty in the interpretation results.},

  abstract = {Ground settlements above a tunnel as a result of tunnel construction can be predicted with the help of input variables that have direct physical significance. Several empirical and artificial intelligence methods for estimating ground settlements have been established by researchers. However, these methods have some limitations because the large number of influential factors involved makes tunnel-ground interaction complicated. In this work, a random forest (RF) was developed and employed to predict ground settlements above tunnels. To achieve this goal, tunnel geometry, geological properties, and construction parameters were investigated as input variables to utilize in the RF modeling, resulting in the maximum surface settlement value (Smax) and trough width (i) as the ground surface settlement index. To demonstrate the applicability of the RF model, two data sets associated with different features, which were obtained from a detailed investigation of different tunnel projects published in literature, were utilized for model development and were applied to check the performance capacity of the developed model. A fivefold cross-validation procedure was then applied to identify the optimal parameter values during modeling, and an external testing set was employed to validate the prediction performance of the model. Two performance measures, R{$^2$} and RMS error, were employed. The relative importance of different parameters in the prediction of ground settlements was also investigated. Findings demonstrate that the RF method provides promising results and offers an alternative means in predicting ground settlements induced by tunneling.}

  abstract = {Geo-hazard assessment of the potential damage to a pipeline caused by a submarine landslide requires a quantitative model to evaluate the impact forces on the pipeline. In contrast with typical geotechnical problems, the strain rate within the fast moving, flow-like submarine landslide is typically far higher, which will lead to enhancement of the soil strength and therefore result in larger impact forces. Generally, there are two possible predictive frameworks for strain-rate dependence: a fluid dynamics framework and a geotechnical framework. By comparison of common rheological models adopted in these two different approaches, a unified additive power-law model, a normalised form of the Herschel--Bulkley model from fluid mechanics, is explored in this paper. This model has been used in conjunction with a large deformation finite element approach to investigate the undrained limiting loads on a cylinder moving steadily through inertia-less soft rate-dependent material, in order to quantify the strain-rate effects. The flow mechanism and the effects of the shear-thinning index and Oldroyd number on the shear zones are explored. The calculated resistance factors are compared with the drag coefficients obtained from computational fluid dynamics analysis. The average rate of strain experienced by the soil flowing past the cylinder is estimated for a given flow velocity and an expression in the form of a conventional bearing capacity equation, but with shear strength linked directly to the normalised flow velocity, is proposed to predict the magnitude of the viscous force exerted by the debris flow.},
