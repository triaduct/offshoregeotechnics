    "text": "## A Virtual Lab for Experimenting with Differential Equations\nThese materials are intended as set of activities to experiment and explore differential equations. Each interactive Jupyter notebooks is a “virtual laboratory” where we perform our experiments and summarize the results. The objectives of experimental mathematics are generally to make mathematics more tangible, lively and fun.\nThe intent of introducing Python is not to avoid a deep and rigorous understanding of differential equations and simply use Python to solve differential equations. There are other sources that skim the concepts on the surface and focus on the coding side of things. These materials use Python as an additional tool for further exploring differential equations to gain a deeper insight into modeling with differential equations. Some of the objectives of implementing Python code cells into the materials are to:\n\nDiscover patterns and relationships.\nUse graphical displays to investigate mathematical concepts.\nDevelop and test conjectures.\nExplore results to help construct proofs.\nConfirm analytically derived results.\nGain further insight and intuition.\nBridge the divide between theory and practice.&lt;",

You cannot edit the text or run code in the html version, but there is a link to each Jupyter notebook at the start of each section.\n\n\nAt the top of each notebook is a “button” such as the one above.\nClick the button to open an interactive Jupyter notebook version in Google Colaboratory (or Colab).\nYou can begin working with the notebook right away in Colab! There is no software to install (or purchase!).\nYou can also access the materials directly on GitHub at https://github.com/CU-Denver-MathStats-OER/ODEs.git.\n\nEach Jupyter notebook contains both narrative text (in Markdown cells) and Python code cells that you can create, modify, and run. Although you do not need a Google account to interact with the notebooks, the Colab notebooks are “shared”, meaning you cannot save any changes to the initial shared document that opens. If you would like to save your changes, you first need to save a copy to your Google Drive. Then you can edit and save changes to your own version.",

    "text": "What Programming Background is Required?\n\nNo prior experience or knowledge of Python, Markdown, LaTeX, or Colaboratory is assumed or required to begin working with these materials. After working with these materials, you will have some knowledge and experience with Python, Markdown, LaTeX, and Colaboratory!\n\nWelcome to Colaboratory is a helpful notebook (with videos) to help introduce you to Colab.\nHere’s a helpful Markdown guide\n\n\nWhat is Python?\n\nWe will be using Python as a tool for experimenting with differential equations. Python is a widely used programming language suited for many purposes and applications such as computational mathematics, data science, and app development. We will create, modify, and run Python code in Jupyter notebooks. No prior programming experience is required to begin working in Python in these materials.\nThe goal of these materials are to investigate differential equations, not learn how to be an expert Python coder. The hope is that we can use Python as a tool for experimenting and gaining insight into differential equations, and in the process, gain a familiarity with Python and coding so it is no longer a barrier. Have I mentioned no prior programming experience is required to begin working in Python in these materials?\nThere are two Python modules (ode_tools.py and mass_spring.py) that accompany these materials with scripts to perform certain tasks such as plotting slope fields, Euler’s method, plotting phase planes, and widgets for experimenting with mass-spring systems. Whenever these modules are used, instructions are provided. There are more detailed instructions found:\n\nQuick Reference for Python Functions: Chapter 1\nQuick Reference for Python Functions: Chapter 2\nQuick Reference for Python Functions: Chapter 3\n\n\n\nWhat is LaTex?\n\nLaTeX is a system for rendering nice looking mathematical symbols, expressions, and equations. All of the mathematical notation in these materials are created using LaTeX. You can view and edit all of the LaTeX code in the Markdown cells. You do not need to become an expert in LaTeX, but having a familiarity with LaTeX is quite helpful and LaTeX can be used to typeset math in a number of different applications.\n\nHere is a useful dictionary of LaTeX math symbols to get a glimpse of LaTeX.",
