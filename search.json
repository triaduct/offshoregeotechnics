It correlates the shaft resistance \\(q_s\\) to the undrained shear strength \\(s_u\\) by:\n\\[\nq_s = \\alpha s_u\n\\]\nThe method also distinguishes between soft normally consolidated clays and stiff overconsolidated clays since their volumetric response will also affect stress development. Therefore \\(\\alpha\\) is determined as follows:\nFor soft (NC) clays where \\(s_u &lt; \\sigma'_{v0}\\): \\[\\alpha = 0.5(\\frac{s_u}{\\sigma'_{v0}})^{-0.5}\\]\nFor stiff (OC) clays where \\(s_u &gt; \\sigma'_{v0}\\): \\[\\alpha = 0.5(\\frac{s_u}{\\sigma'_{v0}})^{-0.25}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nNote that this is a different method entirely to NEN 9997-1 design method which relates the shaft capacity to the cone tip resistance using \\(\\alpha_s\\) (or \\(\\alpha_p\\) for the base capacity).\n\n\n\n\nBase capacity\nThe base capacity is then determined by relating \\(s_u\\) to \\(q_b\\) with the bearing capacity factor \\(N_c\\):\n\\[\nq_{b,0.1} = N_c s_u\n\\]\nwhere \\(N_c\\) is typically taken as 9.\nTo account for plugging behaviour, the API RP-2A method considers just two plugging scenarios: a fully plugged pile (\\(IFR=0\\)) and a fully coring pile (\\(IFR=1\\)). Assuming \\(q_{s,external} = q_{s,internal} = q_{plug}\\):\n\nIf \\(q_{plug} &gt; q_{b,0.1}\\): assume \\(Q_b\\) acts over the whole base area (i.e.¬†fully plugged)\nIf \\(q_{plug} &lt; q_{b,0.1}\\): assume \\(Q_b\\) acts over the pile annulus (i.e.¬†fully coring)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA pitfall of alpha methods\n\n\n\n\n\nPile installation modifies the \\(s_u\\) profile adjacent to the pile shaft, generally creating a weaker, remoulded interface zone where the operational \\(\\delta_f\\) values bear no resemblance to the intact soil‚Äôs \\(s_u\\) or \\(s_u / \\sigma'_{v0}\\) values. Therefore in practice, the true \\(\\alpha\\) (\\(= q_s/s_u\\)) value may vary considerably with soil type and position along the pile shaft and so the method generally shows a low reliability (jardineICPDesignMethods2005, Lehane et al. 2022) in spite of its common use in practice.",

As an example, while \\(A_{re}\\) was used to give an indication of plugging behaviour in sand, \\(D^*\\) is used in clay, providing a simplified means of reflect the lower level of displacement induced during installation of a pipe pile:\n\\[\nD^* = (D^2 - D^2_i)^{0.5} \\quad \\text{for an open-ended pile}\n\\]\n\\[\nD^* = D \\quad \\text{for a closed-ended pile}\n\\]\n\nShaft capacity\nBased on the calibration procedure employed by Lehane et al. (2022), the following provided the best estimate of the shaft capacity:\n\\[\nq_s = 0.07 F_{st} q_t \\max[1,(h/D^*)]^{-0.25}\n\\]\nwhere \\(F_{st} = 1\\) for clays in Zones 2, 3 and 4 in the normalised soil behaviour type chart (Robertson (2010)) and \\(F_{st} = 0.5 \\pm 0.2\\) for Zone 1 (sensitive) clays.\nThis provides a means of estimating the shaft resistance when the degree of excess pore pressure dissipation after driving is more than 80% (i.e.¬†the average in the Unified database).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe Unified method does not explicitly account for tensile loading (unlike sand where \\(f_t / f_c = 0.7\\)). Tests up until now have not shown a clear dependency of shaft capacity in clay on the load direction, so it‚Äôs simply assumed that the tensile capacity in clay is the same as the compressive capacity.\n\n\n\n\nBase capacity\nFor the base capacity, two simple formulations were given:\nFor closed-ended piles: \\[q_{b,0.1} = 0.8 q_t \\] For open-ended piles: \\[q_{b,0.1} = 0.4 q_t \\]\nHowever for large diameter offshore piles, the following is suggested:\n\\[\nq_{b,0.1} = (0.2 + 0.6A_{re})q_t\n\\]\nwhere \\(q_t\\) is the average corrected cone resistance value in the zone extending from the pile tip to a depth of \\(20t\\) below the pile tip (\\(t\\) = pile wall thickness). Both \\(A_{re}\\) and \\(PLR\\) are calculated in the same way as sandy soils.",

    "text": "Design methods\n\nEffective stress design\nModelling the series of stress changes that take place from installation to operational loading is often too complex for routine design. Therefore, design methods usually correlate the pile base and shaft capacities to in-situ soil properties, assessed prior to installation.\nThe methods in API RP-2D reflect this. The code considers a ‚Äútotal stress method‚Äù for soils that behave mainly undrained (also known as the ‚Äúalpha‚Äù method) and an ‚Äúeffective stress method‚Äù for soils that behave drained. Therefore, for drained sandy soils we take the effective stress method, where for the shaft friction:\n\\[\nq_s = \\beta_s \\sigma'_v = K \\tan{\\delta}  \\sigma'_v\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\beta_s\\) is a shaft friction factor given in Table¬†1, \\(K\\) is the lateral earth pressure coefficient and \\(\\sigma'_v\\) is the in-situ vertical effective stress.\nFor the base resistance:\n\\[\nq_b = N_q \\sigma'_v\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(N_q\\) is an end-bearing factor given in Table¬†1.\nThere are also some other prescriptions by the API design method:\n\nTable¬†1 also includes ‚Äúlimiting resistances‚Äù, describing the maximum base and shaft capacity that can be used for designing a pile.\nThe \\(\\beta\\) coefficients cited in Table¬†1 are for open-ended piles. To account for the increase in soil displacement, \\(\\beta\\) is increased by 25% for closed-ended piles. \\(N_q\\) remains unchanged.\nThe internal shaft resistance of an open-ended pile is assumed to be equal to the external shaft resistance\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: API RP-2D design approach for open-ended piles.

CPT-based have certain advantages over traditional stress-based approaches since (1) the mechanisms affecting a CPT and a pile are broadly comparable and (2) the CPT provides a reliable estimate of the in-situ soil conditions, particularly for soils where it‚Äôs difficult to collect clean, undisturbed borehole samples.\n\nDutch method (NEN 9997-1)\nWhile not an offshore design code per se, the CPT-based method in NEN 9997-1 underlies the basic principles of CPT-based design whereby:\n\\[\nq_b = \\alpha_p q_{c,avg}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\\[\nq_s = \\alpha_s q_c\n\\tag{4}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha_p\\) and \\(\\alpha_s\\) are correlation coefficients which depend on the method of installation, and \\(q_{c,avg}\\) is determined using the Koppejan 4D/8D method. For driven closed-ended piles, \\(\\alpha_p = 0.70\\) and \\(\\alpha_s = 0.010\\).\nJust like the API method, NEN 9997-1 also includes limiting resistances on the base (15 MPa) and shaft (CPT \\(q_c\\) profile limited to 12-15 MPa) respectively.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOpen tubular piles are treated separately to other pile types in the 2025 update to NEN 9997-1, aligning with the guidance document CUR 2001-8: Bearing capacity of steel pipe piles.\nThe CUR 2001-8 method won‚Äôt be covered here, there is also an impending update to the method which will align the method more with the Unified pile design method.",

    "text": "Recent research into CPT-based pile design\n\nDatabase assessments\nWhile a penetrating pile mobilises base resistances (or annular resistances) comparable to the cone tip resistance (i.e.¬†\\(q_b / q_c = 1\\)), Figure¬†4 shows that \\(q_{b,0.1} / q_{c,filter} = 0.5\\) (also referred to as \\(\\alpha_p\\), Equation¬†3).\nThere‚Äôs a couple of reasons for this. Importantly, residual loads aren‚Äôt included in this comparison nad therefore \\(q_{b,0.1}\\) desn‚Äôt necessarily represent the true base resistances mobilised. Moreover, it‚Äôs also plausible that had several of the piles had been loaded further beyond \\(s_b = 0.1D\\), they would have mobilised more resistance‚Äîin-line with installation observations.\nFurthermore, the results from load tests in very dense sands at the Maasvlakte (Duffy et al. 2024) also show the conservatism in using limiting resistances: with the API effective stress method and NEN underestimating the resistance of these piles by up to 50%.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Measured base resistances (\\(q_{b,0.1D}\\)) from closed-ended piles in the ISO/API database (Lehane et al. 2017), Dutch database (CUR) and tests from the Port of Rotterdam (Amaliahaven and Waalhaven). \\(q_{c,filter}\\) was determined using the method by de Boorder, de Lange, and Gavin (2022)\n\n\n\n\n\nFinal filling ratio (FFR)\nIn the previous section, we were introduced to the Plug Length Ratio (PLR) and how a plugged pile affects the radial stress regime around the pile itself. It should be noted that the PLR is a reflection of the entire installation process itself. Yet when we look at the operational capacity of a pile, its base resistance will invariably be affected by what happened as the pile approach its final depth during installation (Figure¬†5).\nThe final filling ratio (FFR) is therefore used when determining the pile capacity. The FFR is taken as the average IFR over the final three pile diameters of installation.\nGiven the similarity between a closed-ended pile and a plugged open-ended pile, the effective area ratio \\(A_{re}\\) is often used to quantify the behaviour of an open-ended pile based on the ratio of displaced soil to the gross pile volume (i.e.¬†a fully plugged pile):\n\\[\nA_{re} = 1 - FFR \\frac{D_i^2}{D_o^2}\n\\]\nTypical offshore piles have a wall thickness \\(D/t \\approx 40\\), for which \\(A_{re} \\approx 0.1\\) during unplugged penetration. As Figure¬†5 shows, \\(\\alpha_p\\) varies from 0.5 (i.e.¬†a closed-ended pile), down to around 0.15‚Äîessentially the same base resistance as a bored pile. In essence, this all shows the influence of prestressing on the pile base capacity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Influence of plugging over the final 2‚Äì3 pile diameters on the mobilised based resistance\n\n\n\n\n\nUnified method\nUp until 2020, four different CPT-based design methods were prescribed in API RP-2A:\n\nFugro-05\nICP-05\nNGI-05\nUWA-05\n\nThese were an improvement on rudimentary formulations such as Equation¬†1 or Equation¬†3 and explicitly accounted for phenomenae such as dilatant behaviour under loading or friction fatigue. However, there was a lack of agreement between the industry and researchers between the precise formulations for each phenomena, as well as the calibration of the methods themselves.\nTherefore, as part of a joint industry effort to harmonise design procedures, a so-called ‚ÄúUnified‚Äù pile design method was recently developed (Lehane et al. (2020)) and incorporated into the ISO 19901-4 and API RP 2A standards. This method was calibrated based on a high quality database of instrumented pile load tests, presented in Lehane et al. (2017).\nThe method is outlined in full in Table¬†2 below.\n\n\n\nTable¬†2: Unified pile design method in sand (Lehane et al. 2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShaft resistance\n\n\n\n\n\n\\(Q_s = \\pi D \\int_0^L q_s \\, dz\\)\n\n\n\n\\(q_s = \\left(\\frac{f_t}{f_c}\\right) (\\sigma'_{rc} + \\Delta \\sigma'_{rd}) \\tan(29^\\circ)\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\sigma'_{rc} = \\frac{q_c}{44} A_{re}^{0.3} [\\max\\left(1,\\frac{h}{D}\\right)]^{-0.4}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\Delta \\sigma'_{rd} = (\\frac{q_c}{10}) ((\\frac{q_c}{\\sigma'_v})^{-0.33}) (\\frac{d_{CPT}}{D})\\)\n\n\n\n\\(\\frac{f_t}{f_c} = \\begin{cases} 1.0 & \\text{(compression)} \\\\ 0.75 & \\text{(tension)} \\end{cases}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(A_{re} = 1 - \\text{PLR} \\frac{D_i}{D}^2\\)\n\n\n\nBase resistance\n\n\n\n\\(Q_b = q_{b,0.1} \\left(\\frac{\\pi D^2}{4}\\right)\\)\n\n\n\n\\(q_{b,0.1} = (0.12 + 0.38 A_{re}) q_{c,avg}\\)\n\n\n\n\\(A_{re} = 1 - \\text{FFR} \\left(\\frac{D_i}{D}\\right)^2 \\approx 1 - \\text{PLR} \\left(\\frac{D_i}{D}\\right)^2\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome other remarks:\n\nThere isn‚Äôt one particular averaging method that is recommended for determining \\(q_{c,avg}\\). For homogeneous sands, the LCPC 1.5D method can be used. For more variable strata, the Koppejan 4D/8D method can be used, where \\(q_{c,avg} = 1.2*q_{c,4D/8D}\\). Otherwise, the filter method by Boulanger and DeJong (2018) can be used.\nTo account for the soil plug, \\(q_{c,avg}\\) is determined using the diameter of an equivalent pile, whose area is equal to the effective area ratio \\(A_{re}\\)\nFor piles under tension, the resistance is factored down by \\(f_t / f_c = 0.75\\). This is a result of a reverse Poisson‚Äôs ratio effect as the pile extends under tension loading, thus also reversing the loads from compressive pile driving.\nWhere plug measurements are not available, the Unified method also recommends a formulation for predicting the plug response:\n\n\\[\nPLR \\approx \\tanh\\left(0.3 \\left(\\frac{D_i}{d_{CPT}}\\right)^{0.5}\\right)\n\\]",

    "text": "Plate tectonics and marine zones\nThe earth‚Äôs crust is broken into pieces is broken into separate pieces called tectonic plates. These plates essentially float atop of the mantle, almost like a thick molten tar, and can move independently and interact with one another. This gives rise to events such as collisions, subduction (when one plate plunges beneath the other) or sliding, which have a huge impact on the geological landscape we see today.\nTectonic plates can be made from one of two different types of material: (1) the less-dense continental crust and (2) the more-dense oceanic crust. The continental crust is also much thicker (as much as 100 km) than the oceanic crust (only about 5 km thick). However, the differences in density leads to most of continental crust floating up above sea level, unlike the oceanic crust.\nThere‚Äôs therefore a significant elevation change as we go from land to the deep ocean (Figure¬†1 (b)). To keep these changes in mind, the marine environment is therefore classified into four main zones:\n\nThe continental shelf\nThe continental slope\nThe continental rise\nThe abyssal plain\n\nThere are seldom any offshore activities in general on the continental rise and the abyssal plain, with most of it taking place on the continental shelf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Marine zones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Hypsometric curve showing the different marine zones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1\n\n\n\n\nContinental shelf\nThe continental shelf is the shallowest part of the seafloor, essentially representing the flooded extension of each continental plate. The continental shelf rarely reaches depths of more than 200m and also has a relatively gentle gradient (1¬∞).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: The continental shelf makes up the areas in light blue‚Äìwith just the minor exception of some mid-ocean ridges formed at tectonic plate boundaries\n\n\n\nThe shallow waters of the continental shelf means that offshore projects are usually located on the continental shelf‚Äîespecially offshore wind projects. However, continental shelves also tend to be quite complex from a geological point-of-view. Changes in sea level means that continental shelves may have once between subject to the different onshore geological processes, as shown later in Section¬†3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: 50,000 years of deposition across the Dutch North Sea Sector\n\n\n\n\n\nPast glacial activity meant that the marine conditions across the Dutch North Sea Sector were much different in the past. Worldwide temperatures were much colder in the late-Pleistocene epoch (at least 10,000 years ago). Therefore, glaciers and ice caps were also much larger, bringing with it a global reduction in sea levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: What the Dutch coast may have looked like the end of the Pleisotecene epoch (10,000-20,000 years ago)\n\n\n\nAs a result, the Netherlands and the UK were directly connected by land‚Äîan area known as Doggerland. Just like today, the Rhine-Maas-Scheldt rivers flowed through the Netherlands and out across Doggerland, bringing clay, silt and sand from the mountains in Germany, Luxembourg and beyond. As the river slowed down across the relatively gently sloping Doggerland, sands and gravels were given a chance to come out of suspension, and the clays and silts continued on in transportation towards the then-coastline, where the river starts to come to a sandstill. These sands often belong to sand formation known as the Kreftenheye Formation, a formation colloquially known as simply the ‚ÄúPleistocene sand‚Äù to Dutch onshore engineers.\nThe start of the Holocene epoch (10,000 years ago to present day) was signified by warmer temperatures and rising sea levels. Once again, the depositional environment in the North Sea changed from fluvial (river) deposits to marine deposits‚Äîgenerally a shell-rich sand formation known as the Southern Bight Formation. Onshore in the Netherlands, stagnating water gave the opportunity for clays and silts to deposit, as well as the formation of peat bogs‚Äîleading to the soft soils enveloping much of the country today.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the daily action of winds, waves, tides and coastal erosion means the continental shelf can still be an environment in flux. Morphodynamic surveys are therefore an important part of the design and planning‚Äìdescribing the study of how dynamic processses, particularly those related to water and sediment movement, shape the Earth‚Äôs surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Bathymetric chart from Hollandse Kust West, showing sand waves (large-scale features in red) and megaripples offshorewind.rvo.nl\n\n\n\n\n\nContinental slope\nThe continental slope is a steep slope (up to 30¬∞) that marks the seaward edge of the continental shelf, transitioning to the gently sloping abyssal plain (in other words, transitioning from continental to oceanic crust). The topography and geology in this area is complex: dictated by mass-wasting processes like slope failures, submarine canyons and turbidity currents.\n\n\nContinental rise\nThe continental rise describes the reducing gradient as the continental slope approaches the abyssal plain. The zone consists of primarily accumulated sediment. This come from mass-wasting processes occurring further up on the continental slope: with gravity bringing the sediment downwards, settling down on the continental rise. Alternatively, the sediment may accumulate at the end of submarine canyons (Figure¬†2), forming what are known as alluvial fans.\n\n\nAbyssal plain\nThe abyssal plain is the deep ocean floor that lies directly on the top of the oceanic crust. It is generally smooth and unaffected by many geological or hydrodynamical activities with the only exception of some mass movement processes or turbidity currents. The low sedimentation rate means the abyssal plain is often composed of very soft, underconsolidated sediments.",

Here, the stratigraphy often governed by the same geological processes that affect onshore deposition, with deposits being supplied from rivers, coastal erosion, aeolian or glacial activities. These deposits are known as terrigenous sediment, that is, sediment transported by land. This sediment tends to be granular silicate-based minerals, such as quartz and feldspar, and are usually formed from the erosion of rocks.\nAlternatively, sediment may be deposited through the settling of light, fine-grained particles far away from land where the geological activity is relatively low. These are known as pelagic sediments and they get deposited so slowly, that nearshore and coastal areas are overwhelmed by terrigenous deposits. Pelagic sediment can be derived from onshore deposits which get blown into the ocean, eventually settling through the water column and onto the seabed.\nBiogenic sediment is a sub-category of pelagic sediment. Biogenic sediment comes from the insoluble remains of marine organisms, like the skeletons of plankton, shells or coral. These insolube remains can be formed of calcite or silica. Calcite organisms are more common in shallow water and temperate tropical climates (giving rise to limestone or chalk), whilst silica organisms are more common in the polar regions or at the equator and in very deep water.\nThe structure of calcitic biogenic sediment (e.g.¬†carbonate sand) can be vastly different to silica sand (Figure¬†5): its almost skeletal-like nature means it is much more prone to crushing compared to silica sand. We‚Äôll see later in the course notes how we respond to these soils from a geotechnical point-of-view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Carbonate vs silica sand (Xiao et al. 2020)",

    "text": "The work of engineers in the offshore sector has changed massively in the past decade, shifting from what was mainly oil and gas structures to offshore wind farms. This can even be seen by the recommended textbooks for this course: Randolph and Gouvernec (2011) and Dean (2010). Both books approach offshore engineering from mainly and oil and gas perspective, whilst also acknowledging the geotechnical uncertainies that were ahead in the growing offshore wind industry.\nThe concepts taught in these books are still highly relevant to offshore and onshore design today, as well as research and designs performed in this era. Yet it‚Äôs important to be aware of the shift in both the research landscape and standardisation. Oil and gas structures tend to be bespoke design at one single location. However, offshore wind farms tend to span tens of kilometres in length (e.g. Figure¬†1) and require replicable and efficient designs at all turbine locations across the wind farm.\nMoreover, the growth in the offshore wind sector is expected to continue to grow in the next couple of decades, with annual installations expected to grow from 8 GW in 2024, to 55 GW by 2034 (GWEC 2025). Since the construction of the first offshore wind farm in Denmark in 1991, Vindeby, the inital growth of offshore wind has been pioneered by the North Sea countries‚Äîlike Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. China now leads offshore wind development, and expansion continues in Europe and other countries like in Taiwan and the United States (Figure¬†2).\nResearch into offshore geotechnics has also rapidly grown as a result, particularly into the influence of wave and wind loading on foundation behaviour. Yet many questions also remain, particularly as many wind farms come into maturity and reach the end of their twenty-five year design lifetime. How might the foundation capacity change over time and how can we decomission or reuse these foundations in a sustainable manner?",

    "section": "Types of offshore structures",
    "text": "Types of offshore structures\nOffshore structures can be categorised into two types: fixed or floating. Choosing the type of structure is dependent on a variety of factors in a variety of engineering disciplines, including geotechnical, hydraulic, mechanical and structrual engineering.\nWhile the structural concepts may differ significantly, the foundation systems used to secure these installations often share common elements. For example, piles or suction caissons may be used both for fixed installations (to resist vertical and lateral loads) and for floating systems (as anchor points for mooring lines). Consequently, geotechnical engineering plays a central role regardless of whether the superstructure is fixed or floating.\n\nFoundations for fixed structures\nMonopiles are perhaps the simplest foundation solution from a manufacturing and structural perspective, making it particularly useful for production in volume. As a a result, monopiles account for at least 70% of all offshore wind installations in Europe (Wind Europe 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Monopile and transition pieces the SIF production facility in the port of Rotterdam\n\n\n\nJacket structures (Figure¬†9) become more cost competitive at deeper water depths (say &gt; 35m), and they are especially common in the oil and gas sector or for substations at offshore farms. A jacket is usually piled into the seabed each, occasionally as a pile group or with a suction bucket at each leg (Figure¬†9 (b)). Jackets are also particularly prevalant in areas enveloped with very soft to soft clays, like in the Gulf of Mexico or Western Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Installation of the ‚Äúpin piles‚Äù at each jacket leg using a jack-up platform (from: BOEM-OPA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Transporting jackets at Seagreen offshore wind farm. Instead of piles, suction buckets are used at each jacket leg (from: Glen Wallace)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Jacket structures, with two different foundation types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Bringing a jacket to its final location\n\n\n\n\n\nJackets are also often too heavy to lift directly. Therefore, they are often ‚Äúskidded‚Äù off quayside to bring the jacket from the manufacturing facility on the quayside to a barge on the water. When the jacket reaches its final destination, it is then ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù off the barge. The buoyancy of the jacket (often improved with additional, temporary buoyancy tanks) is then used used to reduce its weight, helping a crane to orientate it into its final position.\n\n\n\n\n\nGravity-based structures are the behemoths of the offshore industry, and use their own self-weight to resist horizontal loads imposed by wind and waves. Gravity-based foundations were extensively developed for initial oil and gas development in the North Sea where heavily overconsolidated clays and dense sands covered the area, unlike the soft clays of the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions were were less suitable for driving piles in, resulting in gravity-based structures becoming a suitable alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Gravity-based foundations for Fecamp offshore wind farm in France (from: offshorewind.biz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Towing Troll-A gravity-based platform to its final location (from: Equinor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Gravity-based foundations\n\n\n\nAll these structures can be installed using floating barges or ships. However, this also makes construction vulnerable to weather-induced delays such as high winds, waves or swells. Jackups provide an alternative. Jackups are temporary working platforms used for drilling or construction. It consists of a hull and three or more retractable legs, each with fitted with a ‚Äúspud-can‚Äù at the base (Figure¬†6).\nThe geotechnical concepts governing jackup installation are largely dictated by shallow foundation principles. However, the pull-out resistance of the spudcans, along with potential settlement during operation, are also of critical importance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: The bottom of a jack-up leg, known as a spudcan (from: COFS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note on some piling terminology\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several different colloquial terms for all the foundations we see. While there isn‚Äôt a universal agreed-upon definition, some general advice can be:\n\nA pin pile or jacket pile is a slender foundation used to fix each leg of a jacket structures, where the length-to-diameter (slenderness) ratio \\(L/D\\) is at least 10.\nA monopile has an \\(L/D\\) ratio of 8, thus behaving much stiffer compared to a pin pile under horizontal loading.\nA caisson is similar in dimensions to a monopile, but is usually pushed or drilled into place instead of hammered.\nA bucket or skirt has very low \\(L/D\\) ratios, essentially acting as a shallow foundation. Skirts are considered as an add-on to the bottom of a gravity-based foundation to improve the horizontal capacity, whereas buckets is a term usually used for foundations installed with suction pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Some general foundation definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations for floating structures\nInstalling fixed structures in deep waters (say, &gt;100m) is both technically challenging and expensive. Floating structures therefore became more prevalent as oil and gas exploration moved towards uncharted waters. Floating structures have inveitably been less common in the initial development of offshore wind, yet they starting to become more common are becoming more and more common‚Äìwith the first commercial wind farm, Hywind in Scotalnd, startingoperation in 2017.\nFrom a structural perspective, there are four main types of floating structures (Figure¬†8), each using different stabilisation mechanisms to minimise rotation of the superstructure:\n\nA spar platform uses ballast to move the centre-of-gravity below the centre-of-buoyancy, providing a counter-moment to any horizontal actions acting on the structure. Therefore, the geometry of the ballast (often cyclindrical) dictates the buoyancy and stability of the structure.\nA barge-type structure is comparable to a ship, with a shallow draft. It uses a large waterplane area and buoyancy provide stability.\nA tension-leg platform (TLP) uses taut steel moorings fixed to the seabed, with the buoyancy of the TLP hull ensuring that the mooring lines are taut at all times.\nA semi-submersible also uses ballast to lower its centre-of-gravity, as well as spreading out its waterplane area to provide additional stability.\n\nFrom a geotechnical perspective, all of these floating structures require moorings that are fixed to anchors at the seabed. The different types of anchors as well as assessing their performance will be explored later in these notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: Types of floating substructures (Scheu et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\nOther structures:\nOffshore structures are also not limited to structures on the same scale as wind turbines or oil and gas platforms. Even the construction of these wind turbines requires the use of temporary structures like mudmats and pile guide frames. These primarily use shallow foundations so we‚Äôll cover them to some extent.\nThis course focusses primarily on offshore foundations and so several things aren‚Äôt covered:\n\nElectricity or fuel also needs to be transferred across the site, and therefore pipelines and or interconnectors have a crucial role to play. While these seem deceptively simple at first glance, anticipating how they will behave over their lifetime is a challenge, particularly with regards to cable burial and the local topography.\nDredging operations are another very common offshore activity that isn‚Äôt covered, particularly since seabed mobility and dredging machines deserve a stand-alone course in itself.\nCoastal infrastucture, like jetties or harbours, aren‚Äôt covered, as well as tunnels and bridge piers/caissons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pile guide frame used for load tests in Taiwan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) TU Delft centrifuge set-up, examining the influence of submarine landslides on pipeline performance (Zhang and Askarinejad 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: Couple more examples of other offshore structures",

    "text": "Features of an offshore site\nEnvironmental loading is one of the main unique features of an offshore site compared to onshore, especially since the relative proportion of horizontal \\(H\\) to vertical \\(V\\) loading is vastly different to onshore structures, where \\(H/V\\) is much lower. An example of some of these loads is given in Figure¬†10, showing how the loads can applied both on the superstructure or on the foundation itself (e.g. Figure¬†10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†10: Loads acting on a wind turbine with a gravity-based foundation\n\n\n\nRandolph and Gouvernec (2011) give a nice example of how Troll A compares to an equivalent onshore structure‚Äîtaking the (now abandoned) Dubai Towers skyscraper in Doha, Qatar. The self-weight of both structures is pretty comparable, but the environmental loads on Troll A are around 500% greater than on Dubai Towers‚Äîespecially wave and current loading. Therefore, Troll A requires a much larger foundation area.\nCrucially, this horizontal loading also creates a lever arm rotating about the bottom of the platform. Therefore in deep waters (say, 100m), overturning will become the dominant failure mechanism. Conversely, in shallow waters, \\(M/HD\\) typically lies in the range 0.35‚Äì0.70, and so sliding could become the dominant failure mechanism.\nImportantly, environmental loads are often time-dependent in nature, and thus cyclical loading becomes an even more critical design criteria for offshore geotechnics. Due to the dominance of environmental loading offshore, accounting for the influence of cyclic loading on the soil response is much more important than for a typical onshore structure. Environmental forces impart significant cyclic horizontal, vertical and moment loads to offshore foundation systems, and generate excess pore water pressures in the vicinity of the foundation, reducing the effective stresses in the seabed.\nEnvironmental loads are usually calculated as part of the structural analysis, which is in turn based on meteorological and oceanographic (metocean) data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11: Comparison between the Troll A gas platform and the now-abandoned Dubai Towers project (Randolph and Gouvernec 2011)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: A one-in-one-hundred-year storm event\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental loads are typically specified in terms of a particular return period. A return period is the average time interval expected between the occurrences of an event of a certain magnitude. Therefore, in any given year, the probability of an \\(N\\) year event happening is approximately\n\\[\np_1 = 1/N\n\\]\nTherefore, the probability that at least one event will happen in the lifespan \\(L\\) of a structure is:\n\\[\np_L = 1-(1-\\frac{1}{N})^L\n\\]\nA 100-year return period, for instance, indicates a 1% probability of such an event occurring in any given year. However, it does not mean that the event will happen exactly once every 100 years.\n\n\n\n\nWind loading\nWind loading is a key environmental action on offshore structures, contributing both directly and indirectly to design considerations. Wind exerts pressure on the exposed parts of the structure above water‚Äîsuch as platforms, turbines, and topsides‚Äîgenerating horizontal forces and overturning moments. Indirectly, wind is the primary driver of surface waves and currents, which usually dominate the geotechnical loading on foundations. While the magnitude of direct wind forces is typically smaller than hydrodynamic loads, they are important for serviceability, fatigue, and operational stability, particularly for tall, slender structures like offshore wind turbines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†12: A metocean mast in the foreground‚Äîyet another structure that becomes much more complicated to install offshore (source)\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrodynamic loading\nHydrodynamic loading describes the forces caused by the motion of the ocean, including:\n\nHorizontal loading caused by ocean waves or currents\nSediment transport (including erosion, scouring or deposition)\n\nJust like wind loads, hydrodynamic forces are both temporally and spatially dependent. For example, ocean currents vary with depth (Figure¬†13); thanks in part to wind stresses on the ocean surface, tides, local topography, and differences in water temperature and salinity that give rise to density-driven circulation.\nAs a result, hydrodynamic loads can vary greatly. Near the coast, where tides, winds, and waves act across the entire water column, loads tend to fluctuate strongly and are often highly variable over relatively short time periods. In the deep ocean, density gradients in the seawater, drive slow but persistent circulation patterns, exerting different kinds of forces on subsea infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†13: Different types of ocean currents (Randolph and Gouvernec 2011)\n\n\n\nSurface waves are another source of environmental loading. Their characteristics change with water depth as they transform from deep-water waves to shallow-water waves, turning into breaking waves as they approach the coastline. Waves that travel beyond the wind-affected zone are referred to as swells. Swells propagate across away from their area of generation and can propagate in directions that differ from the direction of the wind. Swells can come from hundreds of kilometres away, and therefore they don‚Äôt necessarily occur in locally stormy weather.\nBoth waves and currents can then lead to large amounts of sediment transport through the movement of sand-waves across the seabed, erosion and transport of shoreline deposits or scouring around the the footings of a structure. Scouring and sediment transport is of course heavily dependent on the local soil conditions, as well as the shape of the structure itself.\nWhile precisely quantifying these hydrodynamic forces isn‚Äôt often the work of a geotechnical engineer, understanding how these forces vary and their effect on the foundation is still of importance.\n\n\n\n\nIce loading\nJust like wave loading, ice loading is location dependent. How it affects offshore structures depends on its strength, thickness and the velocity at which its moves across the water which are all in turn dependent on the ice age, metocean conditions and water quality‚Äìto name but a few (Sanderson 1988).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†14: Ice-breaking cones at the base of a shallow jacket foundation from Nissum Bredning, Denmark",

    "text": "Standardisation\nIndustry standards and codes provide a reliable basis for aligning expectations about a product or service, giving a framework that engineers can work with when designing a structure. Onshore, the Eurocode and associated National Annexes (like NEN 9997-1) are often the go-to resource‚Äîif not compulsory‚Äîand thus each country usually has their own rules and regulations that are specifically designed for the geotechnical conditions, structures and typical practices of that country.\nHowever offshore projects are often international collaborations, employing consultants and contractors from different countries. Furthermore, the unique structures and challenging installation conditions means many national design standards are not designed to accommodate for such construction projects.\nStandards often give a good overview of a particular topic, as well as being an engineer‚Äôs mainstay for calculations, so its highly recommended to get familiar with the main standards when coming across a new topic. Some standards that are particularly important for offshore geotechnics:\n\nISO 19901 to 19906: Developed by the International Standards Organisation (ISO), primarily based on initial oil and gas development.\nAPI RP-2GEO: Developed by the American Petroleum Institute and a subset of the API RP 2A. There are two versions: a Working Stress Design (WSD) approach and a Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) version (see below)..\nDNV-RP-C212: Developed by the certification authority DNV-GL. The standard is more specifially tailored towards monopile and shallow foundation design.\n\nThese standards are in addition to the litany of other standards (particularly ISO standards) which guide specific things like in-situ testing, different foundation types or load testing.\nNevertheless, standards should not be regarded as static documents. The process of changing a standard takes time and they often do not include more up-to-date design methods‚Äîoften since coming to a universal concensus takes time and plenty of research. For instance, the compartively recent growth of the offshore wind sector also means that current standards may not necesarily reflect the unique challenges of offshore wind (Morgan 2023). Likewise, probabilistic methods or the use artificial intellegence algorithms are still at an elemental level in design standards.\nWhen a design and the calculations are prepared, they then get sent to a certification body, like Det Norske Veritas (DNV) or Bureau Veritas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit state functions\n\n\n\nJust like onshore engineering, offshore design standards are typically written in terms of certain limit states:\n\nThe ultimate limit state (ULS) is the maximum load-carrying capacity of a structure which, if exceeded, would lead to complete collapse.\nThe serviceability limit state (SLS) defines the conditions within which the structure can be kept serviceable. For example, the permanent accumulated rotation at the top of a wind turbine‚Äôs foundation often may not exceed 0.5¬∞.\nAccidental limit state (ALS) corresponds to survival conditions in a damaged condition or in the presence of strongly non-linear environmental conditions or for highly unlikely events, like ship allisions.\nFatigue limit states (FLS) are limiting conditions or failures resulting from continued cyclic loading, although this generally pertains to the structure materials themselves.\n\n\n\n\nFactors of safety\nOne way design standards can greatly differ is with how they deal with safety factors. For instance, API RP-2GEO uses working stress design (WSD) by default, where one global safety factor is applied:\n\\[\nR = (G+Q+E) \\gamma_G\n\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the soil resistance, \\(G\\) is the permanent load, \\(Q\\) is the variable load, \\(E\\) is the environmental load and \\(\\gamma_G\\) is a safety factor applied to the combined effect of the three different loads, chosen based on the type of failure mechanism. In this case \\(\\gamma_G\\) essentially accounts for tthe natural variability of soil properties, measurement errors, statistical uncertainy and model uncertainty in one factor.\nNowadays, design standards are tending to shift towards a Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) approach, like that in NEN 9997-1. With LRFD, the different types of loads are considered explicitly by using partial safety factors:\n\\[\n\\frac{R}{\\gamma_m} = \\gamma_G G + \\gamma_q Q + \\gamma_e E\n\\]\nHaving been originally designally for WSD, API RP 2GEO now has two versions: one for WSD, and the other for LRFD. Nevertheless, nowadays the ISO and API geotechnical codes are generally aligned with one another, with some small exceptions (Colliat-Dangus et al. 2017).",

    "text": "Integrated ground modelling (IGM)\nGround models aim to capture the geological, geomorphological and geotechnical features that may influence short-term offshore activities, such as drilling and rig anchoring, as well as the long-term reliability of offshore foundations (ISO 2023). Ground models for very small and simple projects can consist of one single characteristic soil profile, where the elevation and properties of each soil layer are assumed to be constant across the entire site.\nHowever as sites increase in size, like to the scale of IJmuiden Ver (Figure¬†2), the complexity of the ground model must also increase so that the ground conditions are accurately portrayed. Therefore, ground model development becomes an inter-disciplinary collaboration between engineers, geologists and geophysicists.\nWind farms in particular tend to have a low data density (e.g. Figure¬†4). However, it‚Äôs often easier to gather geophysical data offshore so there‚Äôs an abundance of geophysical data in comparison. Therefore, it‚Äôs still possible to get a relatively clear idea of the stratigraphy across the entire site. Nevertheless, understanding precisely the variation within a layer remains a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Data density at recent wind farm developments in the Dutch North Sea sector (from: Fugro)\n\n\n\nTo efficiently represent the site, the site is divided into ground units and soil provinces (e.g. Figure¬†5). Ground units are layers that are relevant from a geotechnical perspective‚Äîwhich is in turn dependent on the envisaged design (e.g.¬†shallow foundation or a deep foundation pile). Soil provinces then represent geographical areas where the soil stratigraphy and characeristics are relatively similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Soil provinces determined by Fugro at IJmuiden Ver, along with selected CPTs from each province (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\nInterpolating soil properties\nGround modelling has traditionally been a manual task. At each relevant location, such as a monopile foundation, a soil profile is devised and each layer is assigned geotechnical properties based on in-situ and laboratory tests. For offshore wind farms, this process can become laborious and time-consuming, particularly in cases like IJmuiden Ver where hundreds of wind turbine locations may be planned across a vast area.\nGeostatistical techniques, such as kriging and random field modelling, are often the first port-of-call for interpolating between site investigation points and have been used for many years to model and characterise reservoirs in the oil and gas industry. However, data sparsity across offshore wind farms often makes it difficult to estimate the parameters required for geostatistical techniques, particularly with respect to the spatial variability in the horizontal direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Synthetic CPT model at a harbour in the port of Rotterdam\n\n\n\nMore and more research and ground modelling contracts (e.g. Sauvin et al. (2022), Peuchen et al. (2022)) are focussing on ‚Äúnon-parameteric‚Äù machine learning models to generate synthetic CPTs across a given site. These models help to identify correlations and patterns in large, multivariate datasets, integrating the data together into a site-wide model from which synthetic CPTs at turbine locations can be derived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating geophysical and geotechnical data\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs important to be aware of the level of interpretation that goes into developing combined geophysical-geotechnical models. In particular, Vardy et al. (2017) gives a good overview of this:\n\nGeotechnical data always involves some degree of sample disturbance or deformation, unlike geophysical data. This can introduce uncertainties when deriving mechanical parameters from geotechnical and geophysical data\nGeophysical and geotechnical data are collected in what are primarily contrasting strain regimes, where geophysical data generally focusses on very small strain and geotechnical data at larger strains\nWhere geophysical and geotechnical data have been integrated, the methods either are highly qualitative or suffer from large uncertainties due to imprecisely calibrated relationships between the geophysical and geotechnical parameters‚Äîwhich becomes especially a problem in areas with data sparsity.",

    "section": "Seabed vs downhole systems",
    "text": "Seabed vs downhole systems\nWorking on the ocean often requires purpose-built rigs and shipping vessels. For this, there are two types of geotechnical systems for site investigation: seabed and downhole systems.\nSeabed systems are specially designed frames that can be remotely operated for the purpose of cone penetration testing or shallow sampling. This is a relatively fast way of executing tests, however, the depth of penetration is limited by the capacity of the frame.\nFor CPT testing for example, the maximum depth a seabed frame can push a CPT is usually no more than 40m in favourable conditions, thus often rendering it insufficient for deep foundations, particularly in dense sands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: An example of a seabed frame in operation\n\n\n\nTo explore deeper depths and collect samples, downhole systems are used. Downhole systems are connected directly to the drill ship (or jack-up platform) using a drill string. The operations often proceed in an alternating manner (Figure¬†2): first a CPT is pushed through undisturbed soil. The now-disturbed soil is then either drilled out or a sample is taken up to deck, and then the subsequent undisturbed interval is either assessed using a CPT again, or a sample is collected for description and further laboratory testing.\nInevitably, this series of alternating drilling/sampling/testing is a slow process, however, the process allows for deeper samples and measurements to be collected and to some degree, can give detailed geotechnical insights into the subsurface.\nIf exceptionally hard layers encountered in downhole systems, it also possible to drill through and proceed with sampling/testing of subsequent layers, thus offer a good contingency if things go bad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Example of a downhole CPT (Lunne 2012)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Keeping a ship steady during downhole operations\n\n\n\n\n\nKeeping a ship steady during downhole penetration is no easy task. To do so, drilling ships usually use ‚Äúdynamic positioning‚Äù (DP), whereby horizontal bow thrusters below the waterline (Figure¬†3 (a)) counter the motions induced by wind, waves and current so that ship can stay in position without the use anchors.\nHowever, these thrusters only control the rolling and drifting of the ship. Upwards and downwards movements also needed to be counteracted to prevent pressure acting on top of the drill string‚Äìin turn affecting the measurement, or worst case, buckling of the drill string itself. For this, passive heave compensation is used, allowing for the so-called ‚Äúmonkey board‚Äù to stay at the same height relative to seabed whilst the rest of the ship moves around it (Figure¬†3 (b)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Bow thrusters on the side of a ship, also signified by a symbol visible above the waterline\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) View from the deck of a drilling vessel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3",

    "text": "Drilling and sampling\nSamples of the subsurface are required a number of reasons, ranging from simple soil classification to laboratory testing for obtaining geotechnical parameters for design. There are range of different methods (Figure¬†4), the choice of which depends on the desired sample quality, as well as whether or not a seabed or downhole system is being used (which inevitably becomes a question of cost).\nSeabed systems can provide data in a relatively cost-efficient manner. However in terms of soil sampling, seabed systems and associated sampling techniques can only provided information of the upper few metres, and are therefore mainly performed along pipeline or cable routes. Examples of some shallow sampling techniques include:\n\nGrab samples enables the recovery of soil samples from the seabed. Grab samples provide disturbed material for simple soil classification or mineralogical testing.\nBox cores also samples from just the seabed, but can provided relatively undisturbed samples for exploring strength characteristics, particularly through shear vane testing or mini-penetrometer testing.\nA gravity corer (also known as a drop corer) is a steel tube with a heavy mass on top. The corer is dropped from a height several metres above the seabed, obtaining a disturbed sample for soil classification and mineralogical testing.\nJust like a gravity corer, a vibro corer also obtains disturbed sediment in upper few metres of the seabed. However, a vibro corer is generally preferable for harder soil or dense sand, with a vibrator used to essentially liquefy the soil and achieve greater penetration.\nA piston corer gets relatively undisturbed samples of the upper few metres and can also be integrated in with other techniques, like gravity coring.\n\nDownhole systems are generally preferred for obtaining deep, relatively high quality samples. These samples are collected using push or piston sampling, retrieving 1m long segments that are usually first classified and photographed offshore (along with basic index tests like water content, pocket penetrometer), and then prepared for delivery to an onshore laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Different types of sampling methods from Sterk and Stein, 2015",

    "section": "Cone Penetration Testing (CPT)",
    "text": "Cone Penetration Testing (CPT)\nThe CPT has been an essential part of offshore soil investigations across the world. This come in part due to its high measurement frequency (2cm) and its relative ease-of-use in both seabed and downhole systems.\nPore water pressure is also usually measured offshore. Since the hydrostatic pressure is often much higher compared to onshore, a correction for the effect of pore pressure on the cone tip resistance is very important, particularly in soft clays since the overall effect of \\(u_2\\) on \\(q_c\\) becomes much greater. To do so, the the total cone resistance \\(q_t\\) is obtained by:\n\\[\nq_t = q_c + (1-\\alpha)u_2\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the ratio between the area of the cone shoulder (not acted on by pore pressure) to the total cross-sectional area of the cone shaft. For 10cm2 cones (the most common type), \\(\\alpha\\) is typically equal to 0.75. For 15cm2 cones, \\(\\alpha\\) is typically equal to 0.59.\nThe cone tip resistance is highly dependent on the in-situ stress conditions, especially the horizontal effective stress (Houlsby and Hitchman 1988; Lehane 2024). Therefore, to distinugish the component of cone resistance coming from the overburden pressure and that provided by the soil, the ‚Äúnet‚Äù cone resistance \\(q_{net}\\) is often used:\n\\[\nq_{net} = q_t - \\sigma_{v0}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{v0}\\) is the total overburden stress.\nSome other common normalised parameters include:\n\nNormalised cone tip resistance, \\(Q_t=q_{net}/\\sigma'_{v0}\\), sometimes also referred to as \\(Q\\)\nExcess pore pressure ratio, \\(B_q = (u_2-u_0)/q_{net}\\), where \\(u_0\\) is the hydrostatic water pressure\nFriction ratio, \\(F_r = f_s/q_{net}\\)\n\nThese can all be incorporated into classification charts, such as Figure¬†5. Robertson (1990) (Figure¬†5 (a)) is often the go-to chart for geotechnical engineers to understand how the soil behaves‚Äìgiving the soil behaviour type (SBT).\nHowever, the effects of increasing overconsolidation ratio or the effects of partially-drained (intermediate) soils becomes difficult to distinguish based on just \\(Q_t\\) and \\(F_r\\) alone. Hence, Figure¬†5 (b) by Schneider et al. (2008) becomes another way of distinguishing these soils by incorporating the excess pore pressure ratio \\(B_q\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Robertson (1990), include the approximations used for determining \\(I_c\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Schneider et al. (2008), using \\(B_q\\) to distinguish the soil behaviour types further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: CPT-based classification charts\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5 returns categorical data. However, Figure¬†5 (a) was pseudo-digitised by Jefferies and Davies (1993) to give the normalised soil behaviour type index \\(I_c\\):\n\\[\nI_c = [(3.47-\\log(Q_{tn})^2) + (\\log F_r +1.22)^2)]^{0.5}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Soil behaviour type indices\n\n\n\nThe normalised soil behaviour type index (SBTn) is referred to as \\(I_c\\). The non-normalised soil behaviour type index is referred to as \\(I_{SBT}\\).\n\n\nBeyond just soil classification, CPTs are also regularly used for deriving geotechnical properties like the undrained shear strength \\(s_u\\) or the relative density \\(D_r\\). These are all together too numerous to include in these notes, although as a quick first reference you can refer to Greggs‚Äô CPT Guide. Some correlations are also available in the Python package CPyT under cpyt.interpretation.correlations.\n\nVariations on the traditional CPT cone\nThe geometry and execution procedure of a regular cone penetration test is standardised in ISO 22476-1. Yet CPTs can also come with a range of different add-ons to obtain different kinds of data. The thermal CPT (T-CPT) is a variation of the thermal needle probe, and can be used to readily assess the thermal conductivity of the soil (Vardon, Baltoukas, and Peuchen 2018) so that the thermal insulation (or energy loss) around pipelines and interconnector cables can be better understood.\nCPTs can also come in various different geometries, particularly full-flow penetrometers like the T-bar or the ball probe (Figure¬†6). Full-flow penetrometers are used to obtain intact and remoulded undrained strength profiles in very soft to soft soil since‚Äîin principle‚Äîthey allow for soft soil to flow around the penetrometer. This mechanism offers several advantages (DeJong, Yafrate, and DeGroot 2011):\n\nImproved accuracy in soft soils since a large surface area of the probe can interact with the surrounding soil‚Äìa surface area up to ten times larger than a CPT cone\nCorrections for overburden are less compared to a conventional CPT (Equation¬†2) because the overburden stress above and below the penetrometer is nearly equal\nPenetration resistance is less affected by soil rigidity and stress anisotropy because the resistance measured is a function of the soil flow around the probe, rather than of complete soil displacement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Different types of CPT cones\n\n\n\n\n\nSeismic cone penetration test (SCPT)\nThe SCPT integrates geophones into the CPT rod itself. Often, two sets of geophones are placed at a fixed interval from one another (e.g. Figure¬†7), with each set consisting of three geophones which measures seismic velocities in the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) directions‚Äìallowing for P-waves and S-waves to be distinguished from one another. Using one geophone set is also a possible (‚Äúpseudo-interval method‚Äù), but this requires additional post-processing and a good quality seismic source\nTypically, the SCPT focusses on getting a good quality measurement of the shear wave velocity \\(V_s\\) and so an S-wave seismic source is used. The shear wave velocity is then linked to the small-strain shear modulus \\(G_0\\) (also referred to as \\(G_{max}\\)) by:\n\\[\nG_0 = \\rho V_s ^2\n\\tag{4}\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the total soil mass density. Some sample shear wave velocities are included in Table¬†1.\nThis can be quite an efficient way of deriving the small-strain shear stiffness, particularly when compared to cross-hole measurements. Nevertheless, several things can affect the quality of SCPT tests, such as the efficacy of the seismic source, the distance between the source and the receiver(s) along with the data processing and interpretation procedure (Koreta et al. 2022; Santos et al. 2023). Repeatability is therefore a critical measure during the test itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Seismic cone penetration test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Shear wave velocities in different soil types\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil type\nShear wave velocity \\(V_s\\) (m/s)\n\n\n\n\nSoft clay\n60 ‚Äì 180\n\n\nLoose sand\n180 ‚Äì 280\n\n\nFirm to stiff clay\n180 ‚Äì 300\n\n\nDense sand\n175 ‚Äì 760",

    "text": "Base resistance\nOne of the first sets of well-instrumented pile tests (particularly with radial stress sensors) came from tests on the so-called Imperial College Pile (ICP) at Labenne, where Lehane (1992) showed that the pile base resistance \\(q_b\\) of a jacked pile was approximately equal to the measured cone resistance \\(q_c\\) from a CPT during installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1: Measured pile base resistances at Labenne (LB) compared to CPT cone resistance (Lehane 1992)\n\n\n\nThis is in some way unsurprising: the CPT also follows a similar mode of installation compared to a pile after all. But what‚Äôs actually going on underneath a CPT or a pile during penetration?\nDuring this process, there‚Äôs a whole load of changes going on underneath the pile base. Soil is being displaced or forced away from the pile, increasing the radial stresses (horizontal stresses) acting on the pile. As well as that, sand is not only densifying underneath pile base, but also crushing‚Äîturning into a tightly compacted, very fine sand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Schematic explanation (Yang et al. 2010)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Photo from digital image correlation (DIC) tests by Tovar-Valencia et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo\n\n\n(c) Video from DIC tests showing slow, crushing of particles during penetration (Tovar-Valencia et al. 2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Examples of soil crushing underneath the base of a CPT/conical pile (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDoes it make a difference if it‚Äôs a conical tip or flat tip?\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of base resistance, probably not‚Äîat least at a macroscopic level. Underneath a flat-bottomed pile, a ‚Äúnose cone‚Äù of densified, highly crushed sand forms (White and Bolton (2004), Figure¬†3). Constant shearing along the edges of this nose still leads to slip failures occurring along the edges, meaning soil still passes up along the pile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Nose cone underneath a model pile installed in a calibration chamber\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccounting for scale effects\nInevitably, the amount of soil that is disturbed by the pile is going to be dependent on the pile‚Äôs diameter. As a result, a pile has a sensing distance and development distance (Figure¬†4), describing the zone of influence around the pile tip.\nAs an example, if a strong layer is underlying a weak layer, the pile will begin to sense the strong layer before it reaches the actual interface. This is because the pile‚Äôs base resistance depends not just on the soil at precisely the same level as the pile base itself, but also on the soil below it‚Äìknown as the sensing distance.\nConversely, the weak layer will also continue to affect the pile base resistance until it gets sufficiently deep into the sand layer‚Äìthis is known as the development distance.\nThe lengths of the sensing and development distances are of course dependent on the pile diameter, but they‚Äôre also dependent on the relative strengths of the layers themselves (Boulanger and DeJong 2018).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Influence of multi-layered penetration on a CPT (White and Bolton 2004)\n\n\n\nTo model this spatially dependent behaviour, so-called averaging methods have been developed. These methods are particularly common in CPT-based design methods, where the CPT measurements have to be scaled up to the size of a pile in order to predict the base resistance.\nIn the Netherlands and worldwide, the Koppejan 4D/8D method (van Mierlo and Koppejan 1952) is one of the most well known averaging methods. However recent studies (Bittar, Tian, and Lehane 2022; de Boorder, de Lange, and Gavin 2022; Duffy et al. 2024) have shown that the Koppejan method isn‚Äôt so accurate in accounting for size differences between a CPT and a pile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nOften the output from an averaging method algorithm is referred to as \\(q_{c,avg}\\), but be aware that this does not refer to the arithmetic average! The latest Unified method in sand instead refers to this output as \\(q_p\\).\n\n\nWith this in mind, Boulanger and DeJong (2018) proposed a new averaging method known as the filter method. The filter method corrects for the influence of surrounding layers on the base resistance by using two weightings: one accounting for the distance from the pile base, and the second accounting for differences in soil strength.\nNevertheless, the method by Boulanger and DeJong (2018) was developed specifically for liquefaction assessment, not for pile resistance. While it gives improved understanding of the pile base resistance (relative to a CPT), several minor adjustments have been proposed to the method (e.g. Bittar, Tian, and Lehane (2022), Tian and Lehane (2025)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA worked example from the calibration chamber in Deltares\n\n\n\n\n\nTake for instance the calibration chamber tests performed by de Lange (2018) in the calibration chamber in Deltares. A multi-layered scenario was created with five weak clay layers within a thick layer of sand. A ‚Äútrue‚Äù \\(q_c\\) value was established for both the clay and sand through separate tests.\nTherefore, when a CPT (\\(D=35mm\\)) penetrated through this multi-layered sample, it would indicate what layers actually affect the CPT‚Äôs measurement when compared to the true \\(q_c\\) profile. You can see that the filter method models the measured CPT resistances quite well, and certainly much better compared to the Koppejan method.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Calibration chamber set-up by de Lange (2018)\n\n\n\nYou can also check this with the code below. It also includes a hypothetical scenario of a penetrometer with a diameter of 5*d_cpt, whilst also assuming that the filter method by de Boorder, de Lange, and Gavin (2022) is the ground truth.\nSince this hypothetical penetrometer is much larger than the original CPT, it can barely detect the individual contribution of each weak layer. Instead it virtually spatially averages the whole unit, sensing a cone resistance of just under 1 MPa.\nAs an aside: since the stress conditions in a calibration chamber are much different to real-life conditions, the measured cone resistance are also not ‚Äútypical‚Äù cone resistances.\n\n\nShow the code\nimport pandas as pd, numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport sys\n\n# sys.path.append(\"..\")\n# !pip install git+https://github.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics.git@main # Use this code to add offshoregeotechnics to your Python library \n\nfrom utils import averaging_methods\n\nfig = plt.figure()\nax = fig.gca()\n\n# Measurements from calibration chamber as well as existing calcs (to reduce computational time) are stored in calib-chamber.csv\ncsv_url = \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/triaduct/offshoregeotechnics/main/notes/data/calib-chamber.csv\"\ncpt = pd.read_csv(csv_url)\nd_cpt = 36E-3 # Original diameter of the CPT cone = 36mm\nax.plot(cpt.qc,cpt.z*-1,label=\"True $q_c$\",lw=0.75,c=\"gray\",ls=\":\")       # True qc value if layer was infinitely thick\nax.plot(cpt.qc_meas,cpt.z_meas*-1,label=\"Measured $q_c$\",c=\"k\",ls=\"--\")   # Measured by a CPT with diameter D_cpt\nax.plot(cpt.qc_koppejan,cpt.z_koppejan*-1,label=\"Koppejan ($D=D_{cpt}$)\",c=\"#C21301\")  # Koppejan method (D = D_cpt)\nax.plot(cpt.qc_filter,cpt.z_filter*-1,label=\"Filter method ($D=D_{cpt}$)\",c=\"#00A6D6\") # Filter method by De Boorder, 2022 (D = D_cpt)\n\n# ===============================\n# Consider a hypothetical scenario, with a pile diameter X times the original CPT diameter\nX = 5  # Hypothetical diameter = X*d_cpt\n# ===============================\n\n# Arrays for storing data\nqc_avg_deb = []\nz_lst = []\nfor end_depth in np.arange(-1.5,0,0.01):    # Performing calculation at these depths\n    # qc_avg_deb.append(averaging_methods.lcpc(cpt, X*d_cpt, end_depth))   # Alternatively: feel free to consider the LCPC 1.5D method!\n    qc_avg_deb.append(averaging_methods.de_boorder(cpt, X*d_cpt, end_depth))\n    z_lst.append(end_depth)\nax.plot(qc_avg_deb,np.array(z_lst)*(-1),label=f\"Hypothetical ($D=$\" +  str(X) + \"$D_{cpt}$)\",c=\"green\",lw=2)\n\n# Other plot settings\nax.set_xlabel(\"Cone resistance, $q_c$ (MPa)\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Depth (m)\")\nax.legend(fontsize=9,ncol=3,loc=\"center left\",bbox_to_anchor=(-0.1,-0.15))\nax.set_xlim(0,2.5)\nax.set_ylim(0,1)\nax.tick_params(labelbottom=False,labeltop=True)\nax.xaxis.set_label_position('top')\nax.xaxis.set_ticks_position('top')\nax.invert_yaxis()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the code yourself in Google Colab!",

    "text": "Shaft resistance\nThrough model tests on instrumented piles, Lehane et al. (1993), Chow (1997) and Lim and Lehane (2015) have shown that the shaft friction \\(q_s\\) on a displacement pile obeys Coulomb‚Äôs Law where:\n\\[\nq_s = \\sigma'_{rf} \\tan(\\delta_f) = (\\sigma'_{rc} + \\Delta \\sigma'_{rd}) \\tan(\\delta_f)\n\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma'_{rf}\\) is the radial effective stress at peak friction, \\(\\delta_f\\) is the ultimate constant volume interface friction, \\(\\sigma'_{rc}\\) is the stationary radial effective stress and \\(\\Delta \\sigma'_{rd}\\) is the increase in radial effective stress under axial loading that is caused by dilation.\n\nStationary radial effective stress \\(\\sigma'_{rc}\\)\nVesic (1970) and Lehane (1992) (among others), observed that the radial effective stress \\(\\sigma'_{rf}\\) of a jacked or driven pile reduces as the distance from the pile tip \\(h\\) increases, like shown in Figure¬†6.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Measured radial stresses from Labenne (adapted from Lehane (1992))\n\n\n\nThis phenomenon is known as friction fatigue and is caused by the contraction of sand at the pile-soil interface, which in turn reduces the far-field radial stresses acting on the pile (Figure¬†10 (b)). The amount of friction fatigue continues to develop as the pile penetrates deeper and deeper and so elevations that have experienced more loading cycles (caused by pile hammering or jacking increments) will have reduced radial effective stresses compared to horizons further down the pile.\nThe contraction stiffness of the sand, or the degree at which it wants to contract, also depends on the pile diameter (Jardine et al. 2013). As a result (and as we will see in the next section), design methods often express friction fatigue as a function of \\(h/D\\)‚Äîin other words: the normalised distance from the pile base.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Close-up picture of the penetrometer-soil interface by Arshad et al. (2014)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Mechanism proposed by White and Bolton (2004), where Zone B is the area of highly crushed soil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Insights into the mechanisms causing friction fatigue\n\n\n\n\n\nInterface friction angle \\(\\delta\\)\nAs with any interface between two materials, understanding the interaction between the two materials is a key step in understanding the frictional resistance between them. For this, the interface frction angle \\(\\delta_f\\) is used, which is a function of the pile roughness and soil properties, where \\(\\delta_f = \\phi'\\) represents a perfectly rough interface, while \\(\\delta_f = 0\\) represents a perfectly smooth interface.\nSomewhat intuitively, initial studies and design methods (e.g. Jardine, Lehane, and Everton (1992)) suggested that \\(\\delta_f\\) varies with the mean particle diameter \\(D_{50}\\), or more specifically, the relative roughness of the interface compared to the particle size).\nHowever, several studies (e.g. Yang et al. (2010), Ho, Jardine, and Anh-Minh (2011), Liu et al. (2019)) have shown that this is less likely to be the case, largely because of the high levels of particle breakage underneath the pile tip, which passes up along the pile-soil interface (Figure¬†10).\nNevertheless, as Figure¬†8 shows, there‚Äôs quite some variation in ring shear tests performed in the laboratory‚Äîpartly because of the influence of fines content, interface roughness and shearing rate and so site-specific tests are generally recommended for determining \\(\\delta_f\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: Variation in \\(\\delta_f\\) with mean particle size \\(D_{50}\\) (Liu et al. 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\nChange in radial stress under loading \\(\\Delta \\sigma'_{rd}\\)\nThe restraint to dilation at the pile shaft during pile loading provided by the surrounding sand leads to an increase in radial stress on the pile shaft \\(\\Delta \\sigma'_{rd}\\) and hence to the peak shaft friction. This increase can be expressed from cavity expansion theory by \\(\\Delta \\sigma'_{rd} = 4G ¬∑ \\Delta r / D\\) (Lehane and Jardine (1994)), where \\(G\\) is the shear modulus and \\(y\\) is the dilation of the sand at the shaft interface.\nSince the degree of dilation is inversely proportional to the pile diameter \\(D\\), dilation is usually only significant for small diameter piles. Therefore, this dilation component becomes very important when extrapolating the results of small-scale laboratory tests (depending on the relative mean particle size and pile diameter) to full-scale piles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe influence of \\(\\Delta \\sigma'_{rd}\\) on the friction sleeve resistance \\(f_s\\) is also one of the reasons why \\(f_s\\) is not often used in CPT-based design methods. Measurement inaccuracies is also another reason (Lunne, Robertson, and Powell (1997)).\n\n\n\n\nResidual stresses\nDriving a precast pile generates a substantial amount of stresses in the pile and the surrounding soil. Under each blow, the pile body and soil beneath the pile base compress and deform, partially rebounding after each blow. When the pile rebounds upwards, the stresses relax underneath the pile base whilst negative shear stresses mobilise along the pile shaft (Figure¬†9 (b)).\nEventually, an equilibrium is reached between the upward and downward stresses‚Äìwith all these stresses being referred to as residual stresses. These residual stresses remain on the pile, even with no load being applied on the top of the pile\nFor design, it‚Äôs not necessary to know the amount of residual stresses, after all, it‚Äôs more important to understand the relative response of the pile to an applied load. Nevertheless, residual loads are important for interpreting pile tests where knowing the absolute magnitude of \\(q_b\\) and \\(q_s\\) is needed, especially when compared to site investigation tests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Response of the pile underneath each hammer blow\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Measurements of residual loads At Amaliahaven from after pile driving, but before load testing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: Residual loads creating by the installation of a precast pile",

    "section": "Plug resistance",
    "text": "Plug resistance\nAll of the mechanisms mentioned up until now also affect tubular piles. However, one key mechanism that distinguishes open-ended piles from closed-ended piles is plugging.\nPlugging refers to the process by which soil enters and accumulates inside a tubular pile, forming a column of soil that stops more soil from entering the pilepile. This affects the pile‚Äôs behaviour during both installation and operational loading, since plugging also displaces soil around the pile as it penetrates through the ground.\nThis means the open-ended piles have both an annular resistance \\(q_{ann}\\) and a plug resistance \\(q_{plug}\\) (which includes the inner shaft resistance). As we will see in the next chapter, design methods often lump both of these into the pile‚Äôs base resistance where \\(q_b = q_{ann} + q_{plug}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Fully coring (\\(PLR = 1\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Partially plugged (\\(0 \\le PLR \\le 1\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Fully plugged (\\(PLR = 0\\))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11: Plugging in an open-ended pile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantifying the amount of plugging\n\n\n\nThe amount of the plugging that has occurred can be quantified in a few different ways:\n\nThe plug length ratio (\\(PLR\\)) is a measurement after pile installation, where the elevation of the plug inside the tubular pile is measured directly, i.e.:\n\n\\[\nPLR = \\frac{L_p}{L}\n\\tag{1}\\]\n\nThe incremental filling ratio (\\(IFR\\)) is a measurement of the change in plug height over a given penetration \\(\\Delta L_p\\). It is therefore a measurement made during pile installation:\n\n\\[\nIFR = \\frac{\\Delta L_p}{\\Delta L}\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\nThe final filling ratio (\\(FFR\\)) is the average IFR over the final three pile diameters of installation.\n\n\n\n\nWhy does plugging occur?\nA series of different mechanisms occurs when a pile plugs (Figure¬†12). At first, soil freely enters the pile. The internal stress state is low and so the plug height grows at nearly the same rate as the penetration depth (\\(IFR = 1\\)). Shear stresses acting on the inside of the pile are comparable to those acting outside of the pile.\nYet shaft friction is also mobilising along the inside of the pile wall during this process, especially towards the bottom of the pile. As this friction continues to build up, stress chains or arches around the inside of the pile. Eventually, this zone of influence becomes so large that the the soil eventually locks up, with the arches being strong enough to resist further intrusion of soil into the pile. At this stage, the pile acts fully plugged (\\(IFR = 0\\)) and forces soil around the pile.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Cerfontaine et al. (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Li et al. (2021)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†12: Summaries of two Discrete Element Method studies of plugging in open-ended piles\n\n\n\nJust like a closed-ended pile, a plugged open-ended pile has a nose ‚Äúcone‚Äù of dense sand towards the bottom (Figure¬†12 (a)). This means the base response of a fully plugged pile is very similar to a closed-ended pile during installation. Therefore, the resistances mobilised by the plug are similar to the CPT cone tip resistance when \\(IFR=0\\) (Figure¬†13).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†13: Dependence of \\(q_{plug} / q_c\\) on \\(IFR\\) during tests on jacked model piles (Lehane and Gavin 2001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: How do we measure the contribution of the pile plug during experiments?\n\n\n\n\n\nStrain sensors measure how much the pile shaft compresses under an axial load‚Äîwhich is in turn correlated to how much shaft resistance each soil layer gives.\nMeasuring the shaft resistance of a closed-ended pile is relatively straightforward. But for an open-ended pile it‚Äôs difficult to separate the plug and external shaft friction contributions from one another, since both of these simultaneously affect how much the steel tube compresses under loading.\nTo do so, a twin-walled pile is often used. Strain sensors attached to the external tube measure solely the external shaft friction, whereas strain sensors attached to the inner tube measure noly the contribution of the soil plug.\nWhile this is of course an optimal solution to quantifying the resistance components individually, often this may not be possible due to costs and time constraints.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Twin-walled model pile setup by Igoe, Gavin, and O‚ÄôKelly (2011)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Assembly of a full-scale twin-walled pile by Han et al. (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†14: Two examples of twin-walled piles for field test experiments\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen does plugging occur?\nThe degree of plugging one would expect during installation is strongly dependent on several factors. Crucially, plugging seldom occurs during the installation of driven tubular piles offshore. There‚Äôs a couple of reasons for this:\n\nThe relative size pile-to-particle diameter significantly reduce the likelihood of the locked-up nose cone from forming. Generally, for piles greater than 1.5m in diameter, it is assumed that plug formation won‚Äôt occur.\nThe acceleration of pile wall relative to the (static) pile plug creates a phase shift or ‚Äúslippage‚Äù under each hammer blow.\n\nWith these factors in mind, there are also ways to mitigate the likelihood of plugging. One method includes water fluidisation, something which is currently being trialled with vibratory installation in the Dutch North Sea Sector (GBM Works). Another solution is a driving shoe (Figure¬†15), which increases the thickness of the pile tip annulus and causes a reduction in horizontal stresses as the soil flows past the shoe (de Nicola and Randolph 1997; Finlay et al. 2001).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†15: Driving shoe at the base of an open-ended pile (Finlay et al. 2001)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs important to realise the physical differences between installation response and operational response (in other words, the dynamic vs static response).\nWhile plugging isn‚Äôt necessarily a concern for large-diameter piles during installation, in the next section we‚Äôll see that the plug response can be quite different under slower, operational loading.\n\n\n\n\nWhat are the other implications of plugging?\nOnce the plug is fully formed, the pile essentially behaves just like a closed-ended pile, displacing the soil around the pile base. As a result, radial stresses will also build up around the pile (Figure¬†16), thus increasing the external shaft resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†16: Influence of plugging on the radial stresses around the pile",

    "text": "Installation\nOn the same Imperial College Pile (ICP) that we looked at when examining the axial capacity of piles in sand, Lehane and Jardine (1994b) measured the radial stresses acting on piles in soft, lightly overconsolidated clay (Bothkennar) and in stiff, overconsolidated clay (Cowden)‚Äîshown in Figure¬†4.\nJust like in sand, the tests showed that piles in clay obey Coulomb‚Äôs Law for the shaft resistance:\n\\[\nq_s = \\sigma'_{rf} \\tan(\\delta_f)\n\\tag{3}\\]\nFurthermore, the model pile mobilised base resistances similar to that of a CPT (i.e.¬†\\(q_b = q_c\\)) during installation. Unsurprisingly, much higher radial stresses were measured in the stiff clay, reaching a maximum radial stres of around 1000 kPa.\nThe piles also mobilised different magnitudes of radial stress depending on how far away the sensors were from the pile tip \\(h\\), suggesting a depth-dependency in the shaft resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Soft, lightly overconsolidated clay at Bothkennar\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Stiff, overconsolidated clay at Cowden\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Radial stress measurements from Imperial College Pile (ICP) tests (Lehane and Jardine 1994a, 1994b)\n\n\n\nThe permeability and strength characteristics also completely change during this process, resulting in large changes in porewater pressures in both the near-field (right next to pile) and the far-field (up to several diameters away from the pile).\nFor instance, Figure¬†5 shows how pore pressures build up as the pile approaches the sensors, partially dissipating as the pile continues on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Response of pore pressure sensors at a fixed horizon, a distance of 1m and 2m away from the ICP pile in (a) lightly overconsolidated silty clay and (b) heavily overconsolidated clay (Doherty and Gavin 2011a). Negative values indicate the pore pressure sensor is below the pile tip.\n\n\n\nSo what exactly is going on during this process? Pile penetration creates a large amount of remoulding around the pile base, leading to the creation of a residual shear plane along the pile shaft through remoulding (Figure¬†6). The clay particles also reorientate from perpendicular to the pile shaft towards near-parallel as they pass from a highly concentrated stress bulb to a slightly more relaxed shear plane around the pile shaft.\nAs a result, the soil immediately surrounding the pile has substantially different properties compared to when we began installation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Mechanisms controlling pile penetration in clay\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing normalised parameters to account for differences in clays\n\n\n\nNormalised parameters help us to compare results across test sites in different soil conditions or to develop generalisable design methods. In sand, we could simply use \\(q_s/q_c\\) or \\(\\sigma'_r/q_c\\)‚Äîexcess pore pressure wasn‚Äôt something we had to worry about.\nA common normalised parameter for clay is \\(S_i\\), a parameter which accounts for differences in local groundwater conditions (where \\(u_0\\) is the hydrostatic pressure) as well as soil strength:\n\n\\[\nS_i = \\frac{\\sigma_{ri}-u_0}{q_t}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\\(h/D\\) effect\nFigure¬†4 shows that the total radial stresses varies depending on the distance from the pile tip‚Äîsuggesting a similar effect to the friction fatigue we observed in sand.\nHowever, unlike sand, crushing and cyclic contraction isn‚Äôt the governing mechanism in clay, and so it isn‚Äôt necessarily ‚Äúfriction fatigue‚Äù that‚Äôs occurring. Instead, there‚Äôs a couple of other mechanisms simultaneously causing this \\(h/D\\) effect (Chow 1997; Gavin et al. 2010):\n\nThe stress history of the soil completely changes as the pile tip moves past, going from its in-situ stress state, to a very high stress state and then back to slightly lower stress state‚Äîwhilst also remoulding. Ultimately, this means that the radial effective stresses will also increase but vary depending on the distance \\(h\\) from the pile tip. This is also helped by partial dissipation of porewater pressures higher up in the pile as the pile continues on penetrating.\nConstant cycling of pile‚Äîunder both jacking or hammering‚Äîwill results in continuous cyclical shear at the pile-soil interface. This cyclical shear will also lead to continuous remoulding of the soil around the interface, thus also reducing its strength.\n\nMoreover Lehane et al. (2022) tells us that the \\(h/D\\) profile in clay is not unique (Figure¬†7), unlike in sand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Normalised shaft resistances, showing variation in friction fatigue profiles (Lehane et al. 2022)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between the normalised radial stress \\(S_i\\) and \\(h/D\\)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code below takes three sites from (Lehane et al. 2022), each with different OCRs. It includes normalised radial stress from installation \\(S_i\\), expressing it as a function of \\(h/D\\):\n\\[\nS_i = A (\\frac{h}{D})^{-c}\n\\]\nHave a look at the code below and adjust the \\(A\\) and \\(c\\) parameters.

    "text": "Influence of overconsolidation\nUndrained shearing of normally consolidated and lightly overconsolidated clays develops positive excess pore pressures. However for stiff, highly overconsolidated clays, shearing can also induce dilation in the adjacent soil mass, creating significant suction pressures (or negative porewater pressures, Figure¬†8).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: Stress‚Äìstrain relationship of normally consolidated, lightly overconsolidated, and heavily overconsolidated clays: (a) void ratio versus mean effective stress, (b) drained tests, and (c) undrained tests (Mitchell and Soga 2005)\n\n\n\nDuring pile penetration, two overlapping effects occur. Shearing along the pile shaft will continue to alter local pore pressures‚Äîtypically increasing in normally consolidated clays and decreasing in stiff, overconsolidated clays. At the same time, stress changes in the far field may invoke a different response, although generally with a build up of pore pressures in both cases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoft, NC clays\nStiff, OC clays\n\n\n\n\nAfter installation: \\(\\Delta u &gt; 0\\) close to pile shaft\nAfter installation: \\(\\Delta u &lt; 0\\) close to pile shaft\n\n\n\\(\\Delta u &gt; 0\\) in far-field\n\\(\\Delta u &gt; 0\\) in far-field\n\n\nDuring equalisation: significant increase in \\(\\sigma'_h\\)\nDuring equalisation: small increase in \\(\\sigma'_h\\), sometimes decrease in heavily overconsolidated clays and silts\n\n\n\n\nInterface friction angle \\(\\delta_f\\)\nThe interface friction angle is a core component of Coulomb‚Äôs Law (Equation¬†3). However, since clay undergoes significant transformations under loading, the interface friction angle becomes quite difficult to quantify. Its magnitude at all phases of the pile‚Äôs lifecycle depends on the soil type, prior shearing history and the pile properties itself, and thus it can cover a wide range‚Äîgenerally from 8¬∞ to 36¬∞.\nThe method and rate of installation also affect the interface response. For instance, Bond (1989) took block samples adjacent to model pile that were installed through both hammering, fast jacking and slow jacking (Figure¬†9).\nHis analysis showed that slow jacking developed one or more smooth, continuous polished residual shear surface (almost like an onion skin) around the pile where the clay particles were aligned parallel to the shaft. However, driving and fast jacking led to multiple, less well-developed matt shear surface on which the degree of particle reorientation was lower.\nSince pile installation considerably modifies the fabric of the soil around the shaft, specially designed ring-shear tests need to be set-up to appropriately model these variations, often by including a series of shearing ‚Äúpulses‚Äù (e.g. Jardine et al. (2005)).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: Comparison of block samples taken at the interface of piles in high OCR clay (Bond 1989)",

    "title": "Basic mechanisms",
    "section": "Equalisation",
    "text": "Equalisation\nDrainage in sand occurs instantly after the end of installation. However, the low permeability of fine-grained, clay soils results in a build-up of excess porewater pressure during installation. A period of equalisation then occurs after installation, where the excess porewater pressures begin to dissipate‚Äîthus increasing the effective stress acting on the pile.\nThe behaviour varies greatly depending on the type of clay and its stress history. An example of this is shown in Figure¬†10. While the general trend is radial effective stress to increase during equalisation (and thus the shaft capacity), highly overconsolidated soils like that of the London clay may exhibit the opposite effect as a result of dilatant shearing during the installation process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†10: Change in radial effective stress \\(\\sigma'_r\\) during consolidation, relative to the radial effective stress at the end of consolidation \\(\\sigma'_{rc}\\) (Jardine et al. 2005)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInfluence of geotechnical ageing on pile capacity in clay\n\n\n\n\n\nAgeing can occur simultaneously during equalisation, as well as after it‚Äôs complete. Ageing generally results in an increase in shaft capacity and the mechanisms which cause it include (Hou, Lehane, and Watson 2025):\n\nCation exchange between pile and soil, leading to enhanced bond strength, reduced water content and a more dilative response.\nDevelopment of a crust layer, shifting the main shearing interface from the pile-soil interface to the soil.\nCreep and stress relaxation processes near the pile interface, leading to an ongoing increase in \\(\\sigma'_r\\).\n\nHowever, the degree to which this is happening is still not well understood or well quantified. This is primarily because separating the influence of consolidation and ageing is especially difficult, as well as separating all the interdependencies from one another.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11: Photos of 12.5mm model piles after ageing has occurred (Hou, Lehane, and Watson 2025)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExercise: How long does it take for a pile to reach 80% consolidation?\n\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll see in the next chapter that 80% consolidation is a typical benchmark for design methods. This consolidation is a function of the diameter of the pile (perhaps more specifically: the diameter of disturbed soil) and the permeability of the soil.\nWith this in mind, use the calculator below to consider three scenarios:\n\nA closed-ended pile, \\(D=100\\) mm\nA fully coring open-ended pile, \\(D_{outer} = 2\\) m, \\(t = 50\\) mm\nA fully plugged open-ended pile, \\(D_{outer} = 2\\) m, \\(t = 50\\) mm\n\nEach pile has been installed into a soil with \\(c_h = 0.05\\) m2/day.\nHow long does it take for each pile to reach 80% consolidation?
