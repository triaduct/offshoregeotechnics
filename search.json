    "text": "Drilling and sampling\nSamples of the subsurface are required a number of reasons, ranging from simple soil classification to laboratory testing for obtaining geotechnical parameters for design. There are range of different methods (Figure¬†4), the choice of which depends on the desired sample quality, as well as whether or not a seabed or downhole system is being used (which inevitably becomes a question of cost).\nAs mentioned before, seabed systems can provide data in a relatively cost-efficient manner. However in terms of soil sampling, seabed systems and associated sampling techniques can only provided information of the upper few metres, and are therefore are more prevelant for investigating the seabed conditions along pipeline routes. Examples of some sampling techniques include:\n\nGrab samples enables the recovery of soil samples from the seabed. Grab samples provide disturbed providing disturbed material for simple soil classification or mineralogical testing.\nBox cores also samples from just the seabed, but can provided relatively undisturbed samples for exploring strength characteristics, particularly through shear vane testing or mini-penetrometer testing.\nA gravity corer (also known as a drop corer) is a steel tube with a heavy mass on top. The corer is dropped from a height several metres above the seabed, obtaining a disturbed sample for soil classification and mineralogical testing.\nJust like a gravity corer, a vibro corer also obtains disturbed sediment in upper few metres of the seabed. However, a vibro corer is generally preferable for harder soil or dense sand, with a vibrator used to essentially liquefy the soil and achieve greater penetration.\nA piston corer gets relatively undisturbed samples of the upper few metres and can also be integrated in with other techniques, like gravity coring.\n\nDownhole systems are generally preferred for obtaining deep, relatively high quality samples. These samples are collected using push or piston sampling, retrieving generally 1m long segments that are usually first classified and photographed offshore (along with basic index tests like water content, pocket penetrometer), and then prepared for delivery to and onshore laboratory\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Different types of sampling methods from Sterk and Stein, 2015",

    "section": "Cone Penetration Testing (CPT)",
    "text": "Cone Penetration Testing (CPT)\nThe CPT has been an essential part of offshore soil investigations across the world. This come in part due to its high measurement frequency (2cm) and its relative ease-of-use in both seabed and downhole systems.\nPore water pressure is also usually measured and since the hydrostatic pressure is often much higher compared to onshore (due to the seawater), a correction for the effect of pore pressure on the cone tipe resistance is important‚Äìyielding the total cone resistance \\(q_t\\):\n\\[\nq_t = q_c + (1-\\alpha)u_2\n\\tag{1}\\]\nwhere \\(\\alpha\\) is the ratio between the area of the cone shoulder (not acted on by pore pressure) to the total cross-sectional area of the cone shaft. For 10cm2 cones (the most common type), \\(\\alpha\\) is typically equal to 0.75. For 15cm2 cones, \\(\\alpha\\) is typically equal to 0.59. Especially important in soft clay [‚Ä¶]\nThe cone tip resistance is highly dependent on the in-situ stress conditions, primarily the horizontal effective stress Lehane (2024). Therefore, to distinugish the component of cone resistance coming from the overburden pressure, from the ‚Äúnet‚Äù cone resistance \\(q_{net}\\) provided by the soil, another derivation is often used:\n\\[\nq_{net} = q_t - \\sigma_{v0}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nwhere \\(\\sigma_{v0}\\) is the total overburden stress.\nSome other common normalised parameters include:\n\nNormalised cone tip resistance, \\(Q_t=q_{net}/\\sigma'_{v0}\\), sometimes also referred to as \\(Q\\)\nExcess pore pressure ratio, \\(B_q = (u_2-u_0)/q_{net}\\), where \\(u_0\\) is the hydrostatic water pressure\nFriction ratio, \\(F_r = f_s/q_{net}\\)\n\nThese can all be incorporated into classification charts, such as Figure¬†5. Robertson (1990) (Figure¬†5 (a)) is often the go-to chart for geotechnical engineers to understand how the soil behaves‚Äìgiving the soil behaviour type (SBT). However, the effects of increasing overconsolidation ratio or the effects of partially-drained (intermediate) soils becomes difficult to distinguish based on just \\(Q_t\\) and \\(F_r\\) alone. Hence, Figure¬†5 (b) by Schneider et al. (2008) becomes another way of distinguishing these soils by incorporating the excess pore pressure ratio \\(B_q\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Robertson (1990), include the approximations used for determining \\(I_c\\)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Schneider et al. (2008), using \\(B_q\\) to distinguish the soil behaviour types further\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: CPT-based classification charts\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5 returns categorical data. However, Figure¬†5 (a) was pseudo-digitised by Jefferies and Davies (1993) to give the normalised soil behaviour type index \\(I_c\\):\n\\[\nI_c = [(3.47-\\log(Q_{tn})^2) + (\\log F_r +1.22)^2)]^{0.5}\n\\tag{3}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Soil behaviour type indices\n\n\n\nThe normalised soil behaviour type index (SBTn) is referred to as \\(I_c\\). The non-normalised soil behaviour type index is referred to as \\(I_{SBT}\\).\n\n\nBeyond just soil classification, CPTs are also regularly used for deriving geotechnical properties like the undrained shear strength \\(s_u\\) or the relative density \\(D_r\\). These are all together too numerous to include in these notes, although as a quick first reference, you can refer to Greggs‚Äô CPT Guide. Some correlations are also available in the Python package CPyT under cpyt.interpretation.correlations.\n\nVariations on the traditional CPT cone\nThe geometry and execution procedure of a regular cone penetration tests is standardised in ISO 22476-1. Yet CPTs can also come with a range of different add-ons to obtain different kinds of data. The thermal CPT (T-CPT) is a variation of the thermal needle probe, and can be used to readily assess the thermal conductivity of the soil (Vardon, Baltoukas, and Peuchen 2018) so that the thermal insulation (or energy loss) around pipelines and interconnector cables can be better understood. Cones can also be equipped with electrical resistivity sensors to provide an estimate of the soil density.\nCPTs can also come in various different geometries, particularly full-flow penetrometers like the T-bar or the ball probe (Figure¬†6). Full-flow penetrometers are primarily used to obtain intact and remoulded undrained strength profiles in very soft to soft soil since‚Äìin principle‚Äìthey allow for soft soil to flow around the penetrometer. This mechanism offers several advantages (DeJong, Yafrate, and DeGroot 2011):\n\nImproved accuracy in soft soils since a large surface area of the probe can interact with the surrounding soil‚Äìa surface area up to ten times larger than a CPT cone\nCorrections for overburden are less compared to a conventional CPT (Equation¬†2) because the overburden stress above and below the penetrometer is nearly equal\nPenetration resistance is less affected by soil rigidity and stress anisotropy because the resistance measured is a function of the soil flow around the probe, rather than of complete soil displacement\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Different types of CPT cones\n\n\n\n\n\nSeismic cone penetration test (SCPT)\nQuite similar to cross-hole or borehole geophysics\nThe SCPT integrates geophones into the CPT rod itself. Often, a two sets of geophones are placed at a fixed interval from one another (e.g. Figure¬†7), with each set consisting of three geophones which measures seismic velocities in the \\(x\\), \\(y\\) and \\(z\\) directions‚Äìallowing for P-waves and S-waves to be distinguished from one another. Using one geophone set is also a possible (‚Äúpseudo-interval method‚Äù), but this requires additional post-processing and a good quality seismic source\nTypically, the SCPT focusses on getting a good quality measurement of the shear wave velocity \\(V_s\\) and so an S-wave seismic source is used. The shear wave velocity is then linked to the small-strain shear modulus \\(G_0\\) (also referred to as \\(G_{max}\\)) by:\n\\[\nG_0 = \\rho V_s ^2\n\\tag{4}\\] where \\(\\rho\\) is the total soil mass density.\nSeveral things can affect the quality of SCPT tests, such as the efficacy of the seismic course, the distance between the source and the receiver(s) along with the data processing and interpretation procedure (Koreta et al. 2022; Santos et al. 2023). Repeatability is therefore a critical measure during the test itself.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Seismic cone penetration test\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable¬†1: Shear wave velocities in different soil types\n\n\n\n\n\nSoil type\nShear wave velocity \\(V_s\\) (m/s)\n\n\n\n\nSoft clay\n60 ‚Äì 180\n\n\nLoose sand\n180 ‚Äì 280\n\n\nFirm to stiff clay\n180 ‚Äì 300\n\n\nDense sand\n175 ‚Äì 760",

    "text": "Integrated ground modelling (IGM)\nGround models aim to capture the geological, geomorphological and geotechnical features that may influence short-term offshore activities, such as drilling and rig anchoring, as well as the long-term reliability of offshore foundations (ISO (2023)). Ground models for very small and simple projects can consist of one single characteristic soil profile, where the elevation and properties of each soil layer are assumed to be constant across the entire site. However, as sites increase in size, the complexity of the ground model must also increase so that the ground conditions are accurately portrayed. Therefore, ground model development becomes an inter-disciplinary collaboration between engineers, geologists and geophysicists.\nWind farms in particular tend to have a low data density (e.g. Figure¬†4), although by comparison, the proliferation of geophysical data means it‚Äôs relatively possible to get a clear picture of layering between investigation points. Nevertheless, understanding precisely the variation within a layer remains a challenge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Data density at recent wind farm developments in the Dutch North Sea sector (from: Fugro)\n\n\n\nTo efficiently represent the site, the site is divided into ground units and soil provinces (e.g. Figure¬†5). Ground units are layers that are relevant from a geotechnical perspective‚Äîwhich is in turn dependent on the envisaged design (e.g.¬†shallow foundation or a deep foundation pile). Soil provinces then represent geographical areas where the soil stratigraphy and characeristics are relatively similar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     \n\n\n\nSoil Provinces determined by Fugro at IJmuiden Ver wind farm zone\n\n\nInterpolating soil properties\nGround modelling has traditionally been a manual task. At each relevant location, such as a monopile foundation, a soil profile is devised and each layer is assigned geotechnical properties based on in-situ and laboratory tests. For offshore wind farms, this process can become laborious and time-consuming, particularly in cases like IJmuiden Ver where hundreds of wind turbine locations may be planned across a vast area.\nGeostatistical techniques, such as kriging and random field modelling, are often the first port-of-call for interpolating between site investigation points and have been used for many years to model and characterise reservoirs in the oil and gas industry. However, data sparsity across offshore wind farms often makes it difficult to estimate the parameters required for geostatistical techniques, particularly with respect to the spatial variability in the horizontal direction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: Synthetic CPT model at a harbour in the port of Rotterdam\n\n\n\nMore and more research and ground modelling contracts (e.g. Sauvin et al. (2022), Peuchen et al. (2022)) are focussing on ‚Äúnon-parameteric‚Äù machine learning models to generate synthetic CPTs across a given site. These models help to identify correlations and patterns in large, multivariate datasets, integrating the data together into a site-wide model from which synthetic CPTs at turbine locations can be derived.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating geophysical and geotechnical data\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs important to be aware of the level of interpretation that goes into developing combined geophysical-geotechnical models. In particular, Vardy et al. (2017) gives a good overview of this:\n\nGeotechnical data always involves some degree of sample disturbance or deformation, unlike geophysical data. This can introduce uncertainties when deriving mechanical parameters from geotechnical and geophysical data\nGeophysical and geotechnical data are collected in what are primarily contrasting strain regimes, where geophysical data generally focusses on very small strain and geotechnical data at larger strains\nWhere geophysical and geotechnical data have been integrated, the methods either are highly qualitative or suffer from large uncertainties due to imprecisely calibrated relationships between the geophysical and geotechnical parameters‚Äîwhich becomes especially a problem in areas with data sparsity.",

    "text": "The work of engineers in the offshore sector has changed massively in the past decade, shifting from what was mainly oil and gas structures to offshore wind farms. This can even be seen by the recommended textbooks for this course: Randolph and Gouvernec (2011) and Dean (2010). Both books approach offshore engineering from mainly and oil and gas perspective, whilst also acknowledging the geotechnical uncertainies that were ahead in the growing offshore wind industry.\nThe concepts taught in these books are still highly relevant to offshore and onshore design today, as well as research and designs performed in this era. Yet it‚Äôs important to be aware of the shift in both the research landscape and standardisation. Oil and gas structures tend to be bespoke design at one single location. However, offshore wind farms tend to span tens of kilometres in length (e.g. Figure¬†1) and require replicable and efficient designs at all turbine locations across the wind farm.\nMoreover, the growth in the offshore wind sector is expected to continue to grow in the next couple of decades, with annual installations expected to grow from 8 GW in 2024, to 55 GW by 2034 (GWEC 2025). Since the construction of the first offshore wind farm in Denmark in 1991, Vindeby, the inital growth of offshore wind has been pioneered by the North Sea countries‚Äîlike Denmark, the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. China now leads offshore wind development, and expansion continues in Europe and other countries like in Taiwan and the United States (Figure¬†2).\nResearch into offshore geotechnics has also rapidly grown as a result, particularly into the influence of wave and wind loading on foundation behaviour. Yet many questions also remain, particularly as many wind farms come into maturity and reach the end of their twenty-five year design lifetime. How might the foundation capacity change over time and how can we decomission or reuse these foundations in a sustainable manner?",

    "section": "Types of offshore structures",
    "text": "Types of offshore structures\nOffshore structures can be categorised into two types: fixed or floating. Choosing the type of structure is dependent on a variety of factors in a variety of engineering disciplines, including geotechnical, hydraulic, mechanical and structrual engineering.\nWhile the structural concepts may differ significantly, the foundation systems used to secure these installations often share common elements. For example, piles or suction caissons may be used both for fixed installations (to resist vertical and lateral loads) and for floating systems (as anchor points for mooring lines). Consequently, geotechnical engineering plays a central role regardless of whether the superstructure is fixed or floating.\n\nFoundations for fixed structures\nMonopiles are perhaps the simplest foundation solution from a manufacturing and structural perspective, making it particularly useful for production in volume. As a a result, monopiles account for at least 70% of all offshore wind installations in Europe (Wind Europe 2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: Monopile and transition pieces the SIF production facility in the port of Rotterdam\n\n\n\nJacket structures (Figure¬†9) become more cost competitive at deeper water depths (say &gt; 35m), and they are especially common in the oil and gas sector or for substations at offshore farms. A jacket is usually piled into the seabed each, occasionally as a pile group or with a suction bucket at each leg (Figure¬†9 (b)). Jackets are also particularly prevalant in areas enveloped with very soft to soft clays, like in the Gulf of Mexico or Western Africa.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Installation of the ‚Äúpin piles‚Äù at each jacket leg using a jack-up platform (from: BOEM-OPA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Transporting jackets at Seagreen offshore wind farm. Instead of piles, suction buckets are used at each jacket leg (from: Glen Wallace)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Jacket structures, with two different foundation types\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: Bringing a jacket to its final location\n\n\n\n\n\nJackets are also often too heavy to lift directly. Therefore, they are often ‚Äúskidded‚Äù off quayside to bring the jacket from the manufacturing facility on the quayside to a barge on the water. When the jacket reaches its final destination, it is then ‚Äúlaunched‚Äù off the barge. The buoyancy of the jacket (often improved with additional, temporary buoyancy tanks) is then used used to reduce its weight, helping a crane to orientate it into its final position.\n\n\n\n\n\nGravity-based structures are the behemoths of the offshore industry, and use their own self-weight to resist horizontal loads imposed by wind and waves. Gravity-based foundations were extensively developed for initial oil and gas development in the North Sea where heavily overconsolidated clays and dense sands covered the area, unlike the soft clays of the Gulf of Mexico. These conditions were were less suitable for driving piles in, resulting in gravity-based structures becoming a suitable alternative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Gravity-based foundations for Fecamp offshore wind farm in France (from: offshorewind.biz)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Towing Troll-A gravity-based platform to its final location (from: Equinor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Gravity-based foundations\n\n\n\nAll these structures can be installed using floating barges or ships. However, this also makes construction vulnerable to weather-induced delays such as high winds, waves or swells. Jackups provide an alternative. Jackups are temporary working platforms used for drilling or construction. It consists of a hull and three or more retractable legs, each with fitted with a ‚Äúspud-can‚Äù at the base (Figure¬†6).\nThe geotechnical concepts governing jackup installation are largely dictated by shallow foundation principles. However, the pull-out resistance of the spudcans, along with potential settlement during operation, are also of critical importance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†6: The bottom of a jack-up leg, known as a spudcan (from: COFS)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note on some piling terminology\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several different colloquial terms for all the foundations we see. While there isn‚Äôt a universal agreed-upon definition, some general advice can be:\n\nA pin pile or jacket pile is a slender foundation used to fix each leg of a jacket structures, where the length-to-diameter (slenderness) ratio \\(L/D\\) is at least 10.\nA monopile has an \\(L/D\\) ratio of 8, thus behaving much stiffer compared to a pin pile under horizontal loading.\nA caisson is similar in dimensions to a monopile, but is usually pushed or drilled into place instead of hammered.\nA bucket or skirt has very low \\(L/D\\) ratios, essentially acting as a shallow foundation. Skirts are considered as an add-on to the bottom of a gravity-based foundation to improve the horizontal capacity, whereas buckets is a term usually used for foundations installed with suction pressure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Some general foundation definitions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFoundations for floating structures\nInstalling fixed structures in deep waters (say, &gt;100m) is both technically challenging and expensive. Floating structures therefore became more prevalent as oil and gas exploration moved towards uncharted waters. Floating structures have inveitably been less common in the initial development of offshore wind, yet they starting to become more common are becoming more and more common‚Äìwith the first commercial wind farm, Hywind in Scotalnd, startingoperation in 2017.\nFrom a structural perspective, there are four main types of floating structures (Figure¬†8), each using different stabilisation mechanisms to minimise rotation of the superstructure:\n\nA spar platform uses ballast to move the centre-of-gravity below the centre-of-buoyancy, providing a counter-moment to any horizontal actions acting on the structure. Therefore, the geometry of the ballast (often cyclindrical) dictates the buoyancy and stability of the structure.\nA barge-type structure is comparable to a ship, with a shallow draft. It uses a large waterplane area and buoyancy provide stability.\nA tension-leg platform (TLP) uses taut steel moorings fixed to the seabed, with the buoyancy of the TLP hull ensuring that the mooring lines are taut at all times.\nA semi-submersible also uses ballast to lower its centre-of-gravity, as well as spreading out its waterplane area to provide additional stability.\n\nFrom a geotechnical perspective, all of these floating structures require moorings that are fixed to anchors at the seabed. The different types of anchors as well as assessing their performance will be explored later in these notes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†8: Types of floating substructures (Scheu et al. 2018)\n\n\n\n\n\nOther structures:\nOffshore structures are also not limited to structures on the same scale as wind turbines or oil and gas platforms. Even the construction of these wind turbines requires the use of temporary structures like mudmats and pile guide frames. These primarily use shallow foundations so we‚Äôll cover them to some extent.\nThis course focusses primarily on offshore foundations and so several things aren‚Äôt covered:\n\nElectricity or fuel also needs to be transferred across the site, and therefore pipelines and or interconnectors have a crucial role to play. While these seem deceptively simple at first glance, anticipating how they will behave over their lifetime is a challenge, particularly with regards to cable burial and the local topography.\nDredging operations are another very common offshore activity that isn‚Äôt covered, particularly since seabed mobility and dredging machines deserve a stand-alone course in itself.\nCoastal infrastucture, like jetties or harbours, aren‚Äôt covered, as well as tunnels and bridge piers/caissons.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Pile guide frame used for load tests in Taiwan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) TU Delft centrifuge set-up, examining the influence of submarine landslides on pipeline performance (Zhang and Askarinejad 2019)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: Couple more examples of other offshore structures",

    "section": "Features of an offshore site",
    "text": "Features of an offshore site\nEnvironmental loading is one of the main unique features of an offshore site compared to onshore, especially since the relative proportion of horizontal \\(H\\) to vertical \\(V\\) loading is vastly different to onshore structures, where \\(H/V\\) is much lower. An example of some of these loads is given in Figure¬†10, showing how the loads can applied both on the superstructure or on the foundation itself (e.g. Figure¬†10).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†10: Loads acting on a wind turbine with a gravity-based foundation\n\n\n\nRandolph and Gouvernec (2011) give a nice example of how Troll A compares to an equivalent onshore structure‚Äîtaking the (now abandoned) Dubai Towers skyscraper in Doha, Qatar. The self-weight of both structures is pretty comparable, but the environmental loads on Troll A are around 500% greater than on Dubai Towers‚Äîespecially wave and current loading. Therefore, Troll A requires a much larger foundation area.\nCrucially, this horizontal loading also creates a lever arm rotating about the bottom of the platform. Therefore in deep waters (say, 100m), overturning will become the dominant failure mechanism. Conversely, in shallow waters, \\(M/HD\\) typically lies in the range 0.35‚Äì0.70, and so sliding could become the dominant failure mechanism.\nImportantly, environmental loads are often time-dependent in nature, and thus cyclical loading becomes an even more critical design criteria for offshore geotechnics. Due to the dominance of environmental loading offshore, accounting for the influence of cyclic loading on the soil response is much more important than for a typical onshore structure. Environmental forces impart significant cyclic horizontal, vertical and moment loads to offshore foundation systems, and generate excess pore water pressures in the vicinity of the foundation, reducing the effective stresses in the seabed.\nEnvironmental loads are usually calculated as part of the structural analysis, which is in turn based on meteorological and oceanographic (metocean) data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†11: Comparison between the Troll A gas platform and the now-abandoned Dubai Towers project (Randolph and Gouvernec 2011)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSide note: A one-in-one-hundred-year storm event\n\n\n\n\n\nEnvironmental loads are typically specified in terms of a particular return period. A return period is the average time interval expected between the occurrences of an event of a certain magnitude. Therefore, in any given year, the probability of an \\(N\\) year event happening is approximately\n\\[\np_1 = 1/N\n\\]\nTherefore, the probability that at least one event will happen in the lifespan \\(L\\) of a structure is:\n\\[\np_L = 1-(1-\\frac{1}{N})^L\n\\]\nA 100-year return period, for instance, indicates a 1% probability of such an event occurring in any given year. However, it does not mean that the event will happen exactly once every 100 years.\n\n\n\n\nWind loading\nWind loading is a key environmental action on offshore structures, contributing both directly and indirectly to design considerations. Wind exerts pressure on the exposed parts of the structure above water‚Äîsuch as platforms, turbines, and topsides‚Äîgenerating horizontal forces and overturning moments. Indirectly, wind is the primary driver of surface waves and currents, which usually dominate the geotechnical loading on foundations. While the magnitude of direct wind forces is typically smaller than hydrodynamic loads, they are important for serviceability, fatigue, and operational stability, particularly for tall, slender structures like offshore wind turbines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†12: A metocean mast in the foreground‚Äîyet another structure that becomes much more complicated to install offshore (source)\n\n\n\n\n\nHydrodynamic loading\nHydrodynamic loading describes the forces caused by the motion of the ocean, including:\n\nHorizontal loading caused by ocean waves or currents\nSediment transport (including erosion, scouring or deposition)\n\nJust like wind loads, hydrodynamic forces are both temporally and spatially dependent. For example, ocean currents vary with depth (Figure¬†13); thanks in part to wind stresses on the ocean surface, tides, local topography, and differences in water temperature and salinity that give rise to density-driven circulation.\nAs a result, hydrodynamic loads can vary greatly. Near the coast, where tides, winds, and waves act across the entire water column, loads tend to fluctuate strongly and are often highly variable over relatively short time periods. In the deep ocean, density gradients in the seawater, drive slow but persistent circulation patterns, exerting different kinds of forces on subsea infrastructure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†13: Different types of ocean currents (Randolph and Gouvernec 2011)\n\n\n\nSurface waves are another source of environmental loading. Their characteristics change with water depth as they transform from deep-water waves to shallow-water waves, turning into breaking waves as they approach the coastline. Waves that travel beyond the wind-affected zone are referred to as swells. Swells propagate across away from their area of generation and can propagate in directions that differ from the direction of the wind. Swells can come from hundreds of kilometres away, and therefore they don‚Äôt necessarily occur in locally stormy weather.\nBoth waves and currents can then lead to large amounts of sediment transport through the movement of sand-waves across the seabed, erosion and transport of shoreline deposits or scouring around the the footings of a structure. Scouring and sediment transport is of course heavily dependent on the local soil conditions, as well as the shape of the structure itself.\nWhile precisely quantifying these hydrodynamic forces isn‚Äôt often the work of a geotechnical engineer, understanding how these forces vary and their effect on the foundation is still of importance.\n\n\n\n\nIce loading\nJust like wave loading, ice loading is location dependent. How it affects offshore structures depends on its strength, thickness and the velocity at which its moves across the water which are all in turn dependent on the ice age, metocean conditions and water quality‚Äìto name but a few (Sanderson 1988).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†14: Ice-breaking cones at the base of a shallow jacket foundation from Nissum Bredning, Denmark",

    "title": "Introduction",
    "section": "Standardisation",
    "text": "Standardisation\nIndustry standards and codes provide a reliable basis for aligning expectations about a product or service, giving a framework that engineers can work with when designing a structure. Onshore, the Eurocode and associated National Annexes (like NEN 9997-1) are often the go-to resource‚Äîif not compulsory‚Äîand thus each country usually has their own rules and regulations that are specifically designed for the geotechnical conditions, structures and typical practices of that country.\nHowever offshore projects are often international collaborations, employing consultants and contractors from different countries. Furthermore, the unique structures and challenging installation conditions means many national design standards are not designed to accommodate for such construction projects.\nStandards often give a good overview of a particular topic, as well as being an engineer‚Äôs mainstay for calculations, so its highly recommended to get familiar with the main standards when coming across a new topic. Some standards that are particularly important for offshore geotechnics:\n\nISO 19901 to 19906: Developed by the International Standards Organisation (ISO), primarily based on initial oil and gas development.\nAPI RP-2GEO: Developed by the American Petroleum Institute and a subset of the API RP 2A. There are two versions: a Working Stress Design (WSD) approach and a Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) version (see below)..\nDNV-RP-C212: Developed by the certification authority DNV-GL. The standard is more specifially tailored towards monopile and shallow foundation design.\n\nThese standards are in addition to the litany of other standards (particularly ISO standards) which guide specific things like in-situ testing, different foundation types or load testing.\nNevertheless, standards should not be regarded as static documents. The process of changing a standard takes time and they often do not include more up-to-date design methods‚Äîoften since coming to a universal concensus takes time and plenty of research. For instance, the compartively recent growth of the offshore wind sector also means that current standards may not necesarily reflect the unique challenges of offshore wind (Morgan 2023). Likewise, probabilistic methods or the use artificial intellegence algorithms are still at an elemental level in design standards.\nWhen a design and the calculations are prepared, they then get sent to a certification body, like Det Norske Veritas (DNV) or Bureau Veritas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLimit state functions\n\n\n\nJust like onshore engineering, offshore design standards are typically written in terms of certain limit states:\n\nThe ultimate limit state (ULS) is the maximum load-carrying capacity of a structure which, if exceeded, would lead to complete collapse.\nThe serviceability limit state (SLS) defines the conditions within which the structure can be kept serviceable. For example, the permanent accumulated rotation at the top of a wind turbine‚Äôs foundation often may not exceed 0.5¬∞.\nAccidental limit state (ALS) corresponds to survival conditions in a damaged condition or in the presence of strongly non-linear environmental conditions or for highly unlikely events, like ship allisions.\nFatigue limit states (FLS) are limiting conditions or failures resulting from continued cyclic loading, although this generally pertains to the structure materials themselves.\n\n\n\n\nFactors of safety\nOne way design standards can greatly differ is with how they deal with safety factors. For instance, API RP-2GEO uses working stress design (WSD) by default, where one global safety factor is applied:\n\\[\nR = (G+Q+E) \\gamma_G\n\\]\nwhere \\(R\\) is the soil resistance, \\(G\\) is the permanent load, \\(Q\\) is the variable load, \\(E\\) is the environmental load and \\(\\gamma_G\\) is a safety factor applied to the combined effect of the three different loads, chosen based on the type of failure mechanism. In this case \\(\\gamma_G\\) essentially accounts for tthe natural variability of soil properties, measurement errors, statistical uncertainy and model uncertainty in one factor.\nNowadays, design standards are tending to shift towards a Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD) approach, like that in NEN 9997-1. With LRFD, the different types of loads are considered explicitly by using partial safety factors:\n\\[\n\\frac{R}{\\gamma_m} = \\gamma_G G + \\gamma_q Q + \\gamma_e E\n\\]\nHaving been originally designally for WSD, API RP 2GEO now has two versions: one for WSD, and the other for LRFD. Nevertheless, nowadays the ISO and API geotechnical codes are generally aligned with one another, with some small exceptions (Colliat-Dangus et al. 2017).",

    "section": "Plate tectonics and marine zones",
    "text": "Plate tectonics and marine zones\nThe earth‚Äôs crust is broken into pieces is broken into separate pieces called tectonic plates. These plates essentially float atop of the mantle, almost like a thick molten tar, and can move independently and interact with one another. This gives rise to events such as collisions, subduction (when one plate plunges beneath the other) or sliding, which have a huge impact on the geological landscape we see today.\nTectonic plates can be made from one of two different types of material: (1) the less-dense continental crust and (2) the more-dense oceanic crust. The continental crust is also much thicker (as much as 100 km) than the oceanic crust (only about 5 km thick). However, the differences in density leads to most of continental crust floating up above sea level, unlike the oceanic crust.\nThere‚Äôs therefore a significant elevation change as we go from land to the deep ocean (Figure¬†1 (b)). To keep these changes in mind, the marine environment is therefore classified into four main zones:\n\nThe continental shelf\nThe continental slope\nThe continental rise\nThe abyssal plain\n\nThere are seldom any offshore activities in general on the continental rise and the abyssal plain, with most of it taking place on the continental shelf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Marine zones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Hypsometric curve showing the different marine zones\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†1\n\n\n\n\nContinental shelf\nThe continental shelf is the shallowest part of the seafloor, essentially representing the flooded extension of each continental plate. The continental shelf rarely reaches depths of more than 200m and also has a relatively gentle gradient (1¬∞).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: The continental shelf makes up the areas in light blue‚Äìwith just the minor exception of some mid-ocean ridges formed at tectonic plate boundaries\n\n\n\nThe shallow waters of the continental shelf means that offshore projects are usually located on the continental shelf‚Äîespecially offshore wind projects. However, continental shelves also tend to be quite complex from a geological point-of-view. Changes in sea level means that continental shelves may have once between subject to the different onshore geological processes, as shown later in Section¬†3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExample: 50,000 years of deposition across the Dutch North Sea Sector\n\n\n\n\n\nPast glacial activity meant that the marine conditions across the Dutch North Sea Sector were much different in the past. Worldwide temperatures were much colder in the late-Pleistocene epoch (at least 10,000 years ago). Therefore, glaciers and ice caps were also much larger, bringing with it a global reduction in sea levels.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†3: What the Dutch coast may have looked like the end of the Pleisotecene epoch (10,000-20,000 years ago)\n\n\n\nAs a result, the Netherlands and the UK were directly connected by land‚Äîan area known as Doggerland. Just like today, the Rhine-Maas-Scheldt rivers flowed through the Netherlands and out across Doggerland, bringing clay, silt and sand from the mountains in Germany, Luxembourg and beyond. As the river slowed down across the relatively gently sloping Doggerland, sands and gravels were given a chance to come out of suspension, and the clays and silts continued on in transportation towards the then-coastline, where the river starts to come to a sandstill. These sands often belong to sand formation known as the Kreftenheye Formation, a formation colloquially known as simply the ‚ÄúPleistocene sand‚Äù to Dutch onshore engineers.\nThe start of the Holocene epoch (10,000 years ago to present day) was signified by warmer temperatures and rising sea levels. Once again, the depositional environment in the North Sea changed from fluvial (river) deposits to marine deposits‚Äîgenerally a shell-rich sand formation known as the Southern Bight Formation. Onshore in the Netherlands, stagnating water gave the opportunity for clays and silts to deposit, as well as the formation of peat bogs‚Äîleading to the soft soils enveloping much of the country today.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the daily action of winds, waves, tides and coastal erosion means the continental shelf can still be an environment in flux. Morphodynamic surveys are therefore an important part of the design and planning‚Äìdescribing the study of how dynamic processses, particularly those related to water and sediment movement, shape the Earth‚Äôs surface.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†4: Bathymetric chart from Hollandse Kust West, showing sand waves (large-scale features in red) and megaripples offshorewind.rvo.nl\n\n\n\n\n\nContinental slope\nThe continental slope is a steep slope (up to 30¬∞) that marks the seaward edge of the continental shelf, transitioning to the gently sloping abyssal plain (in other words, transitioning from continental to oceanic crust). The topography and geology in this area is complex: dictated by mass-wasting processes like slope failures, submarine canyons and turbidity currents.\n\n\nContinental rise\nThe continental rise describes the reducing gradient as the continental slope approaches the abyssal plain. The zone consists of primarily accumulated sediment. This come from mass-wasting processes occurring further up on the continental slope: with gravity bringing the sediment downwards, settling down on the continental rise. Alternatively, the sediment may accumulate at the end of submarine canyons (Figure¬†2), forming what are known as alluvial fans.\n\n\nAbyssal plain\nThe abyssal plain is the deep ocean floor that lies directly on the top of the oceanic crust. It is generally smooth and unaffected by many geological or hydrodynamical activities with the only exception of some mass movement processes or turbidity currents. The low sedimentation rate means the abyssal plain is often composed of very soft, underconsolidated sediments.",

    "text": "Marine sediments\nAlthough the continental margins cover only 20% of the seabed, they contain nearly 75% of the total marine seidment. Here, the stratigraphy often governed by the same geological processes that affect onshore deposition, with deposits being supplied from rivers, coastal erosion, aeolian or glacial activities. These deposits are known as terrigenous sediment, that is, sediment transported by land. This sediment tends to be granular silicate-based minerals, such as quartz and feldspar, and are usually formed from the erosion of rocks.\nAlternatively, sediment may be deposited through the settling of light, fine-grained particles far away from land where the geological activity is relatively low. These are known as pelagic sediments and they get deposited so slowly, that nearshore and coastal areas are overwhelmed by terrigenous deposits. Pelagic sediment can be derived from onshore deposits which get blown into the ocean, eventually settling through the water column and onto the seabed.\nBiogenic sediment is a sub-category of pelagic sediment. Biogenic sediment comes from the insoluble remains of marine organisms, like the skeletons of plankton, shells or coral. These insolube remains can be formed of calcite or silica. Calcite organisms are more common in shallow water and temperate tropical climates (giving rise to limestone or chalk), whilst silica organisms are more common in the polar regions or at the equator and in very deep water.\nThe structure of calcitic biogenic sediment (e.g.¬†carbonate sand) can be vastly different to silica sand (Figure¬†5): its almost skeletal-like nature means it is much more prone to crushing compared to silica sand. We‚Äôll see later in the course notes how we respond to these soils from a geotechnical point-of-view.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†5: Carbonate vs silica sand (Xiao et al. 2020)",

Evaporitic deposits are also possible in arid regions, as are varved (laminated) soils if there are seasonal fluctuations in inflow rates.\n\n\n Aeolian (wind-blown)\nWind-blown sediment in what are usually dry or well-drained areas, such as around coastal dunes or deserts. Sediment is generally well-sorted, rounded fine sand dominated by quartz.\n\n\n\nFluvial (river-deposited)\nThe resulting sediment largely depends on the type of river and the level of hydrodynamic activity. Often fine-grained sediment gets brought to sea or deposited in lakes or across flood plains. High lateral variability and sometimes erosion and channelisation of underlying sediment.\n\n\n\nGlacial Hugely variable deposits that depend on the specific glacial process. Examples of sediment includes boulder clay (generally unsorted and unstratified) or outwash sediment (mainly gravel, sand and silt of various degrees of sorting)\n\n\nWhether it‚Äôs light, fine-grained clays that get deposited, or heavy, coarse-grained gravels is not just a function of the depositional environment but also the energy within this environment. Taking Figure¬†7 as an example, only heavy sands and gravels can fall out of suspension near the shore‚Äîsince river mouths or wave action (for example) prevents lighter particles from falling out of suspension. The depositional energy will also affect the particle roundness and sphericity.\nNevertheless Figure¬†7 is just a hypothetical example. In reality, local variations and subsequent changes in geological conditions will also affect the type of sediment we see.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Sediment distribution across a shoreline profile, showing the so-called ‚Äúnull point theory‚Äù (source)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Hjulstr√∂m‚Äôs cruve, used for evaluating the likelihood of erosion, transportation or sedimentation in a river (source)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†7: Influence of particle size/weight and flow velocity on the type of deposition that will occur",

There are two main types of echo sounders: singlebeam echo sounders (SBES) and multibeam echo sounders (MBES). MBES systems generally give more detailed seafloor maps, particularly in deepwater (&gt;25m), whereas SBES systems are generally cheaper and more easier to process, and are thus found on all ocean going vessels.\nIt‚Äôs also becoming more common to analyse the backscatter from echo soundings. This can give a very high resolution bathymetry, although samples from seafloor are required to understand the correlation between the soil type and the acoustic wave backscatter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†2: Multibeam echo sounder (MBES),",

However, this process can also be subjective (e.g. Figure¬†9) and highly dependent on the person processing the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†9: Example on how different interpretations of the same seismic data can lead to different results (Gray, Cox, and Calvert 2023)\n\n\n\nArtefacts can also remain on seismic trace after processing (Figure¬†10). Acoustic blanking, for instance, describes when the signal is attenuated or masked by, for example, the presence of natural gas or steep-side channels (buried or otherwise). ‚ÄúSeabed multiples‚Äù are also a common sight in processed seismic traces, caused by the reflected signal bouncing off the water surface and then again off the seabed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure¬†10: Artefacts on a seismic trace from Hollandse Kust West (offshorewind.rvo.nl)\n\n\n\nSeismostratigraphic units are one of the main outputs of the geophysical campaign, and describe geological units that have a distinct seismic expression or are bounded by a distinct layer boundary (i.e.¬†a ‚Äúreflector‚Äù) or horizon above and/or below the formation.
