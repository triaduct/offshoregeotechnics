Therefore in practice, the true $\\alpha$ ($= q_s/s_u$) value may vary considerably with soil type and position along the pile shaft and so the method generally shows a low reliability [jardineICPDesignMethods2005,@lehaneCPTbasedAxialCapacity2022] in spite of its common use in practice.\n",

As an example, while $A_{re}$ was used to give an indication of plugging behaviour in sand, $D^*$ is used in clay, providing a simplified means of reflect the lower level of displacement induced during installation of a pipe pile:\n",
