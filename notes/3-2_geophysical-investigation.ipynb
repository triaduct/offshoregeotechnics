    "An echo sounder is typically used get bathymetry data, thus giving important information into the seabed elevation and slope at a given location, as well as potential (or past) slope failures, seabed obstructions and other geohazards. There are two main types of echo sounders: singlebeam echo sounders (SBES) and multibeam echo sounders (MBES). MBES systems generally give more detailed seafloor maps, particularly in deepwater (>25m), whereas SBES systems are generally cheaper and more easier to process, and are thus found on all ocean going vessels. \n",
    "\n",
    "It's also becoming more common to analyse the backscatter from echo soundings. This can give a very high resolution bathymetry, although samples from seafloor are required to understand the correlation between the soil type and the acoustic wave backscatter.   \n",

    "Side-scan sonar is a method of underwater imaging using pulses of acoustic energy transmitted out the side of a \"towfish\" (or equivalent such as an ROV) and across the seafloor. The reflected energy is then used to assess seabed features (such as shipwrecks or pockmarks) in more detail compared to an echo sounder. While direct bathymetry data can be somewhat inferred from side-scan sonar, it becomes challenging due to the changing altitude of the towfish and length of the seismic shadow cast by seabed obstructions and the towfish itself.  \n",

    "## Magnetometer\n",
    "A magnetomer is used to detect magnetic anomalies on the seabed, such as cables, shipwrecks, debris or anchor chains. Generally these are towed well behind the survey vessel to minimise magnetic inference, and an accurate profile of the total magnetic field at the location is needed so that small magnetic features can be accurately distinguished. \n",

    "# Getting geotechnical properties from geophysical models\n",
    "Geophysical tests are mainly qualitative in nature, that is, they give us an idea of the number of soil layers and the changes in layer boundaries. Of course for geotechnics, obtaining quantitative properties is desirable. These quantitative parameters can include things like soil density, effective stress and porosity, but also especially small-strain parameters like the inital shear stiffness $G_0$—where traditional large-deformation intrusive tests (like the CPT) are not ideal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maybe from previous courses, you have learned that deriving $G_0$ or other small-strain properties is possible with geophysics—like through MASW tests which use a source and receivers (geophones) placed directly on the ground surface. However, geophysics in a marine environment is dealt with differently to onshore, focussing primarily on P-waves which can travel through water and back to the receiver (unlike S-waves). As we've seen throughout this chapter, P-waves can broadly distinguish between granular and cohseive materials, but more detailed lihological information as well as soil behaviour can only be reliabily derived using the S-wave response [@vardyStateoftheartRemoteCharacterization2017].\n",
