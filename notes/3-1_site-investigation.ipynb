    "As a result, geophysical surveys play a much bigger role in offshore works. Furthermore, the challenges of working at sea means geotechnical surveys have to be executed differently, and so often a shallow (seabed) geotechnical survey is performed separately to a deep (downhole) geotechnical survey. \n",

    "Ground models aim to capture the geological, geomorphological and geotechnical features that may influence short-term offshore activities, such as drilling and rig anchoring, as well as the long-term reliability of offshore foundations [@isoOilGasIndustries2023]. Ground models for very small and simple projects can consist of one single characteristic soil profile, where the elevation and properties of each soil layer are assumed to be constant across the entire site. \n",
    "\n",
    "However as sites increase in size, like to the scale of IJmuiden Ver (@fig-ijmuiden-ver), the complexity of the ground model must also increase so that the ground conditions are accurately portrayed. Therefore, ground model development becomes an inter-disciplinary collaboration between engineers, geologists and geophysicists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wind farms in particular tend to have a low data density (e.g. @fig-data-sparsity). However, it's often easier to gather geophysical data offshore so there's an abundance of geophysical data in comparison. Therefore, it's still possible to get a relatively clear idea of the stratigraphy across the entire site. Nevertheless, understanding precisely the variation within a layer remains a challenge. \n",

    "### Interpolating soil properties\n",
    "Ground modelling has traditionally been a manual task. At each relevant location, such as a monopile foundation, a soil profile is devised and each layer is assigned geotechnical properties based on in-situ and laboratory tests. For offshore wind farms, this process can  become laborious and time-consuming, particularly in cases like IJmuiden Ver where hundreds of wind turbine  locations may be planned across a vast area.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Geostatistical techniques, such as kriging and random field modelling, are often the first port-of-call for interpolating between site investigation points and have been used for many years to model and characterise reservoirs in the oil and gas industry. However, data sparsity across offshore wind farms often makes it difficult to estimate the parameters required for geostatistical techniques, particularly with respect to the spatial variability in the horizontal direction. \n",

These models help to identify correlations and patterns in large, multivariate datasets, integrating the data together into a site-wide model from which synthetic CPTs at turbine locations can be derived. \n"
