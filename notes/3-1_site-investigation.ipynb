Furthermore, the challenges of working at sea means geotechnical surveys have to be executed differently, and so often a shallow (seabed) geotechnical survey is performed separately to a deep (downhole) geotechnical survey. \n",

    "Ground models aim to capture the geological, geomorphological and geotechnical features that may influence short-term offshore activities, such as drilling and rig anchoring, as well as the long-term reliability of offshore foundations (@isoOilGasIndustries2023). Ground models for very small and simple projects can consist of one single characteristic soil profile, where the elevation and properties of each soil layer are assumed to be constant across the entire site. However, as sites increase in size, the complexity of the ground model must also increase so that the ground conditions are accurately portrayed. \n",

    "## Interpolation methods\n",
    "Ground modelling has traditionally been a manual task. At each relevant location, such as a monopile foundation, a soil profile is devised and each layer is assigned geotechnical properties based on in-situ and  laboratory tests. For offshore wind farms, this process can  become laborious and time-consuming, particularly in cases like IJmuiden Ver where hundreds of wind turbine  locations may be planned across a vast area.  Geostatistical techniques, such as kriging and random field modelling, are often the first port-of-call for interpolating between site investigation points (e.g. Vessia et al., 2020; Vanneste et al., 2022), and have been used for  many years to model and characterise reservoirs in the oil  and gas industry. However, data sparsity across offshore wind farms often makes it difficult to estimate the  parameters required for geostatistical techniques,  particularly with respect to the spatial variability in the horizontal direction.

    "From Vardy et al. 2017:\n",
    "Effectively integrating geophysical with geotechnical data is \n",
    "altogether more difficult. This is made more complex by the con￾trasting strain regimes. Geophysical data are at relatively low \n",
    "strains, whereas geotechnical data are at large strain (Clayton \n",
    "2011). In addition, intrusive methods cause mechanical deforma￾tion, which can be very significant for high-porosity near-surface \n",
    "sediments during geotechnical sampling procedures (e.g., \n",
    "Clayton, Hight and Hopper 1992; Lunne 2012; Priest et al. 2015). \n",
    "This deformation inherently alters the nature of the sampled \n",
    "material, introducing uncertainties on key mechanical parameters \n",
    "(e.g., porosity, pore pressure, and undrained shear strength) that \n",
    "are difficult to quantify. Where geophysical and geotechnical data \n",
    "have been integrated, the methods either are highly qualitative \n",
    "(e.g., Vanneste et al. 2015) or suffer from large uncertainties due \n",
    "to imprecisely calibrated relationships between the geophysical \n",
    "and geotechnical parameters (e.g., Nauroy et al. 1998).\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, for imaging the stratigraphy of shallow sediments, one often relies on short-offset single-channel seismic recording systems, which do not allow  the derivation of seismic velocities in the subsurface. In contrast,  the use of multichannel streamers would alleviate this problem  on the condition that the channel spacing is sufficiently small (c., 1 m for a typical high-resolution Boomer or Sparker source) and the active length of the streamer is not shorter than the depth to the deepest target.\n",
