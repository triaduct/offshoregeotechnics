    "## Pile-soil interaction\n",
    "We need to define how the pile interacts with the soil to \"complete\" our wave equation model. The core of most driveability assessments and software is based on the rheological framework proposed by @smithPiledrivingAnalysisWave1960. @smithPiledrivingAnalysisWave1960 proposed that the pile displacement $w$ and velocity $v$ as a function of a spring, dashpot and plastic slider (**FIGURE REF**) whereby:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "T = T_s + T_d = Kw + Cv\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* The spring stiffness $K$ models recoverable static resistance, subject to $T_s \\le T_{max}$ (i.e. the limit of the plastic slider)\n",
    "* The plastic slider represents the yield strength of the soil $T_{max}$, essentially the point at which the pile \"slips\" through and no further resistance can be deleloped. The deformation at which $T_{max}$ is referred to as the **soil quake**\n",
    "* The viscous dashpot $C$ adds a rate-dependency into the model, and essentially dampens the movement of the spring. \n",
    "\n",
    "With that said, this is a relatively simple formulation. It misse, and so this modern forms of this equation are typically taken as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \n",
    "T = \\min (1,\\frac{w}{Q})(1+Jv^n)T_{max}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where, generally, the velocity power n is taken as unity, so that the dimensions of the ‘Smith’ damping coefficient J are the inverse of velocity, rather than the dimensions of C in equation (27) which are force per velocity. The quantity, Q, is the ‘quake’ or displacement at which the ultimate  static resistance, Tmax, is mobilised.\n",

    "#### Quake\n",
    "Shaft quakes vary relatively little, with a quake of 2.5 mm generally considered reasonable for most soils. However, toe quakes can vary widely, as the value is highly dependent on the soil stiffness around the pile base (**REF REF**)--something which is dependent on the installation procedure and the soil type, as well as an interdependency between the two (**REF SECTION**)\n",

Smith's damping factor has units of time over length. Although the Smith model was developed over half a century ago, the same basic factors for damping along the shaft, i.e., 0.15 s/m (0.05 s/ft) for sands and 0.65 s/m (0.2 s/ft) for clays are still recommended. Different values are used where measurements are made or in mixed soils. Only the toe damping recommendation changed to 0.5 s/m (0.15 s/ft) for all soil types"
