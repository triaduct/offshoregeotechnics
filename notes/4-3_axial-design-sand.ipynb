    "## Defining pile capacity\n",
    "Pinpointing exactly where pile failure occurred on a load-displacement curve can be a point-of-contention, especially when the load-displacement response suggests either a very \"ductile\" failure mechanism or a strain-hardening response. Ductile failure mechanisms are very common for bored/replacement piles, since the stresses imposed by installation on the surrounding soil was quite low—meaning it takes a lot of displacement to engage all the soil around the pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore design codes can often differ in how they define failure, particularly onshore codes where bored piles are used more often. Most design codes (particularly offshore) determine failure as when **the *base* displacement reaches 10% of the pile diameter** ($s_{b,0.1D}$). Driven piles generally exhibit plunging failure at $s_{b,0.1D}$, and by using the base displacement rather than the head displacement, influence of elastic shortening is removed from what should be a geotechnical calculation, providing a quantifiable and relevant parameter for geotechnical (and structural) design.

    "::: {.callout-tip title=\"**Side note:** Measuring a pile's axial capacity\" collapse=\"true\"}\n",
    "To measure a pile's actual axial capacity, there are several different ways to go about it. **Static load tests** are generally considered the most accurate way of going about it, loading the pile incrementally using, for example, a load test frame with concrete blocks (kentledge) as a reaction force.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet static load tests last at least several hours, if not an entire day, which can often be prohibitive in terms of time (and thus costs) it adds to a project. **Dynamic load tests** are therefore an attractive alternative for getting an indication of the pile capacity. These can come in the form of \"re-strike\" tests, where the pile is equipped with a Pile Driving Analyser (PDA; essentially accelerometers and a strain gauge placed at the pile head) and one final hammer blow is applied. This gives an indication of the load-displacement response at the pile head, and then a wave mathcing program (such as [CAPWAP](https://www.pile.com/products/capwap/)) is used to match and analytical model of the pile to the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rapid load tests** are very similar to dynamic load tests in that they apply an accelerating force onto the pile. However, a cushion/damper on top of the pile prolongs the duration of the blow, ensuring enough time for strain sensors along the pile to pick up the respone and reducing the more dynamic effects on the pile capacity.\n",
