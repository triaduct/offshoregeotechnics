    "The work of engineers in the offshore sector has changed massively in the past decade, shifting from what was mainly oil and gas structures to offshore wind farms. This can even be seen by the recommended textbooks for this course: @randolphOffshoreGeotechnicalEngineering2011 and @deanOffshoreGeotechnicalEngineering2010. Both books approach offshore engineering from mainly and oil and gas perspective, whilst also acknowledging the geotechnical uncertainies that were ahead in the growing offshore wind industry. \n",

    "The concepts taught in these books are still highly relevant to offshore and onshore design today, as well as research and designs performed in this era. Yet it's important to be aware of the shift in both the research landscape and standardisation. Oil and gas structures tend to be bespoke design at one single location. However, offshore wind farms tend to span tens of kilometres in length (e.g. @fig-ijv-extents) and require replicable and efficient designs at all turbine locations across the wind farm.\n",

    "## Types of offshore structures\n",
    "Offshore structures can be categorised into two types: **fixed or floating**. Choosing the type of structure is dependent on a variety of factors in a variety of engineering disciplines, including geotechnical, hydraulic, mechanical and structrual engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the structural concepts may differ significantly, the foundation systems used to secure these installations often share common elements. For example, piles or suction caissons may be used both for fixed installations (to resist vertical and lateral loads) and for floating systems (as anchor points for mooring lines). Consequently, geotechnical engineering plays a central role regardless of whether the superstructure is fixed or floating."

The self-weight of both structures is pretty comparable, but the environmental loads on Troll A are around 500% greater than on Dubai Towers—especially wave and current loading. Therefore, Troll A requires a much larger foundation area. \n",
    "\n",
    "Crucially, this horizontal loading also creates a lever arm rotating about the bottom of the platform. Therefore in deep waters (say, 100m), overturning will become the dominant failure mechanism. Conversely, in shallow waters, $M/HD$ typically lies in the range 0.35--0.70, and so sliding could become the dominant failure mechanism.\n",

Due to the dominance of environmental loading offshore, accounting for the influence of cyclic loading on the soil response is much more important than for a typical onshore structure. Environmental forces impart significant cyclic horizontal, vertical and moment loads to offshore foundation systems, and generate excess pore water pressures in the vicinity of the foundation, reducing the effective stresses in the seabed. \n",

    "### Wind loading\n",
    "Wind loading is a key environmental action on offshore structures, contributing both directly and indirectly to design considerations. Wind exerts pressure on the exposed parts of the structure above water—such as platforms, turbines, and topsides—generating horizontal forces and overturning moments. Indirectly, wind is the primary driver of surface waves and currents, which usually dominate the geotechnical loading on foundations. While the magnitude of direct wind forces is typically smaller than hydrodynamic loads, they are important for serviceability, fatigue, and operational stability, particularly for tall, slender structures like offshore wind turbines.\n",

    "Hydrodynamic loading describes the forces caused by the motion of the ocean, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Horizontal loading caused by ocean waves or currents\n",
    "2. Sediment transport (including erosion, scouring or deposition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like wind loads, hydrodynamic forces are both temporally and spatially dependent. For example, ocean currents vary with depth (@fig-currents); thanks in part to wind stresses on the ocean surface, tides, local topography, and differences in water temperature and salinity that give rise to density-driven circulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, hydrodynamic loads can vary greatly. Near the coast, where tides, winds, and waves act across the entire water column, loads tend to fluctuate strongly and are often highly variable over relatively short time periods. In the deep ocean, density gradients in the seawater, drive slow but persistent circulation patterns, exerting different kinds of forces on subsea infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Different types of ocean currents [@randolphOffshoreGeotechnicalEngineering2011]](pics/currents.PNG){#fig-currents width=60%}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Surface waves** are another source of environmental loading. Their characteristics change with water depth as they transform from deep-water waves to shallow-water waves, turning into breaking waves as they approach the coastline. Waves that travel beyond the wind-affected zone are referred to as **swells**. Swells propagate across away from their area of generation and can propagate in directions that differ from the direction of the wind. Swells can come from hundreds of kilometres away, and therefore they don't necessarily occur in locally stormy weather.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both waves and currents can then lead to large amounts of sediment transport through the movement of sand-waves across the seabed, erosion and transport of shoreline deposits or scouring around the the footings of a structure. Scouring and sediment transport is of course heavily dependent on the local soil conditions, as well as the shape of the structure itself. \n",

Onshore, the Eurocode and associated National Annexes (like NEN 9997-1) are often the go-to resource—if not compulsory—and thus each country usually has their own rules and regulations that are specifically designed for the geotechnical conditions, structures and typical practices of that country. \n",

    "\n",
    "These standards are in addition to the litany of other standards (particularly ISO standards) which guide specific things like in-situ testing, different foundation types or load testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, standards should not be regarded as static documents. The process of changing a standard takes time and they often do not include more up-to-date design methods—often since coming to a universal concensus takes time and plenty of research. For instance, the compartively recent growth of the offshore wind sector also means that current standards may not necesarily reflect the unique challenges of offshore wind [@morganInnovationOffshoreGeoscience2023]. Likewise, probabilistic methods or the use artificial intellegence algorithms are still at an elemental level in design standards. \n",
