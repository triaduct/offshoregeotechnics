    "The work of engineers in the offshore sector has changed massively in the past decade, shifting from what was mainly oil and gas structures to offshore wind farms. This can even be seen by the recommended textbooks for this course: @randolphOffshoreGeotechnicalEngineering2011 and @deanOffshoreGeotechnicalEngineering2010, which primarily approach offshore engineering from and oil and gas perspective. \n",

However, offshore wind farms tend to span tens of kilometres in length (e.g. @fig-ijv-extents) and require replicable and efficient designs at all turbine locations across the wind farm.\n",

    "## Types of offshore structures\n",
    "Offshore structures can be categorised into two types: **fixed or floating**. Choosing the type of structure is dependent on a variety of factors in a variety of engineering disciplines, including geotechnical, hydraulic, mechanical and structrual engineering. \n",
    "\n",
    "While the structural concepts may differ significantly, the foundation systems used to secure these installations often share common elements. For example, piles or suction caissons may be used both for fixed installations (to resist vertical and lateral loads) and for floating systems (as anchor points for mooring lines). Consequently, geotechnical engineering plays a central role regardless of whether the superstructure is fixed or floating."

    "Crucially, this horizontal loading also creates a lever arm rotating about the bottom of the platform and for deep waters (say, 100m), overturning will gradually become the dominant failure mechanism. Conversely, in shallow waters (< 100 m), $M/HD$ typically lies in the range 0.35–0.7, indicating sliding will govern failure.\n",

Due to the dominance of environmental loading offshore, accounting for the influence of cyclic loading on the soil response is much more important than for a typical onshore structure. Environmental forces impart significant cyclic horizontal, vertical and moment loads to offshore foundation systems, and generate excess pore water pressures in the vicinity of the foundation, reducing the effective stresses in the seabed. \n",

    "### Wind loading\n",
    "<mark>REQUIRES EDITING</mark>\n",
    "Wind loading is a key environmental action on offshore structures, contributing both directly and indirectly to design considerations. Directly, wind exerts pressure on exposed parts of the structure above water—such as platforms, turbines, and topsides—generating horizontal forces and overturning moments. Indirectly, wind is the primary driver of surface waves and currents, which usually dominate the geotechnical loading on foundations. While the magnitude of direct wind forces is typically smaller than hydrodynamic loads, they are important for serviceability, fatigue, and operational stability, particularly for tall, slender structures like offshore wind turbines.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hydrodynamic loading\n",
    "Hydrodynamic loading describes the forces caused by the motion of the ocean, including:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Horizontal loading caused by ocean waves or currents\n",
    "2. Sediment transport (including erosion, scouring or deposition)\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like wind loads, hydrodynamic forces are both temporally and spatially dependent. For example, ocean currents vary with depth (@fig-currents); thanks in part to wind stresses on the ocean surface, tides, local topography, and differences in water temperature and salinity that give rise to density-driven circulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, hydrodynamic loads can vary greatly. Near the coast, where tides, winds, and waves act across the entire water column, loads tend to fluctuate strongly and are often highly variable over relatively short time periods. In the deep ocean, density gradients in the seawater, drive slow but persistent circulation patterns, exerting different kinds of forces on subsea infrastructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Different types of ocean currents [@randolphOffshoreGeotechnicalEngineering2011]](pics/currents.PNG){#fig-currents width=60%}\n",
    "\n",
    "Surface waves are another source of environmental loading. Their characteristics change with water depth as they transform from deep-water waves to shallow-water waves, turning into breaking waves as they approach the coastline. Waves that travel beyond the wind-affected zone are referred to as **swells**. Swells propagate across away from their area of generation and can propagate in directions that differ from the direction of the wind. Swells can travel for hundreds and sometimes thousands of kilometres, for instance, swells generated from storms off the Antarctic often reach the equator\n",
    "\n",
    "Both waves and currents can then lead to large amounts of sediment transport through the movement of sand-waves across the seabed, erosion and transport of shoreline deposits or scouring around the the footings of a structure. Scouring and sediment transport is of course heavily dependent on the local soil conditions, and even the structure itself. While precisely quantifying these forces isn't often the work of a geotechnical engineer, understanding the variation within them is. \n",

Nevertheless, standards should not be regarded as static documents and often do not include more contemporary methods that may not yet be readily refined into the standard. For instance, the compartively recent growth of the offshore wind sector also means that current standards may not necesarily reflect the unique challenges of offshore wind [@morganInnovationOffshoreGeoscience2023]. Likewise, probabilistic methods or the use artificial intellegence algorithms are still at an elemental level in design standards. \n",
