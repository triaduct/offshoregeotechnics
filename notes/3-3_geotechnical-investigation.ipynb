    "## Seabed vs downhole systems\n",
    "Working on the ocean often requires purpose-built rigs and shipping vessels. For this, there are two types of geotechnical systems for site investigation: **seabed and downhole systems**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Seabed systems are specially designed frames that can be remotely operated for the purpose of cone penetration testing or shallow sampling. This is a relatively fast way of executing tests, however, the depth of penetration is limited by the capacity of the frame. \n",
    "\n",
    "For CPT testing for example, the maximum depth a seabed frame can push a CPT is usually no more than 40m in favourable conditions, thus often rendering it insufficient for deep foundations, particularly in dense sands. \n",

The operations often proceed in an alternating manner (@fig-downhole-cpt): first a CPT is pushed through undisturbed soil. The now-disturbed soil is then either drilled out or a sample is taken up to deck, and then the subsequent undisturbed interval is either assessed using a CPT again, or a sample is collected for description and further laboratory testing. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inevitably, this series of alternating drilling/sampling/testing is a slow process, however, the process allows for deeper samples and measurements to be collected and to some degree, can give detailed geotechnical insights into the subsurface.  \n",

    "### Variations on the traditional CPT cone\n",
    "The geometry and execution procedure of a regular cone penetration test is standardised in [ISO 22476-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/75661.html). Yet CPTs can also come with a range of different add-ons to obtain different kinds of data. The **thermal CPT (T-CPT)** is a variation of the thermal needle probe, and can be used to readily assess the thermal conductivity of the soil [@vardonInterpretingValidatingThermal2018] so that the thermal insulation (or energy loss) around pipelines and interconnector cables can be better understood.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPTs can also come in various different geometries, particularly **full-flow penetrometers** like the T-bar or the ball probe (@fig-cpt-types). Full-flow penetrometers are used to obtain intact and remoulded undrained strength profiles in very soft to soft soil since—in principle—they allow for soft soil to flow around the penetrometer. This mechanism offers several advantages [@dejongEvaluationUndrainedShear2011]:\n",

Using one geophone set is also a possible (\"pseudo-interval method\"), but this requires additional post-processing and a good quality seismic source \n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, the SCPT focusses on getting a good quality measurement of the shear wave velocity $V_s$ and so an S-wave seismic source is used. The shear wave velocity is then linked to the small-strain shear modulus $G_0$ (also referred to as $G_{max}$) by:\n",
