    "\n",
    "The lumped mass model simulates the pile as a series of masses and springs. The main disadvantage of the lumped mass model (compared to the method of characteristics) is that it's an approximate method as the force is calculated at the spring location whereas the velocity is at the mass location (half a segment length difference).\n",
    "\n",
    "By contrast, the method of characteristics treats the pile as a continuous medium through which the stress wave can propagate. In this approach, the pile is divided into segments of uniform size, with the soil resistance represented as a concentrated load acting between the segments. The stress wave is assumed to travel unchanged through each individual segment and its amplitude is modified only at the junctions where soil resistance is mobilised or where changes in pile section occur. \n",
    "\n",
    "A key advantage of the method of characteristics is that both force and velocity are calculated at the same location in the pile, which makes the method particularly well-suited for wave matching. It also produces twice as many data points along the pile compared to the Smith lumped-mass model for the same time interval, leading to a finer temporal resolution of the pile response.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the limitation of the method is that the length of the elements must be chosen as integer multiples of the product of the time step and the wave propagation velocity. This restriction makes the method less convenient for simulating hammer and cushion behavior, since those components are better represented by springs and dashpots rather than fictitious material segments constrained by wave speed requirements. For these reasons, while the MoC provides a mathematically elegant description of wave propagation in piles, practical applications often prefer lumped-mass wave equation models for handling hammerâ€“cushionâ€“soil interactions.\n",

    "Shaft quakes vary relatively little, with a quake of 2.5 mm generally considered reasonable for most soils. However, toe quakes can vary widely, as the value is highly dependent on the soil stiffness around the pile baseâ€”which is in turn dependent on the installation procedure and the soil type.\n"

Different values are used where measurements are made or in mixed soils. Only the base damping recommendation changed to 0.5 s/m for all soil types\n",

    "## Signal matching \n",
    "Pile driveability analyses focus on efficiency, since they act as a predictive tool that is used before installation. The primary outputs from this model are the simulated driving stresses, blow counts, load profiles and energy transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, signal matching software focus on a more detailed assessment of wave propagation by comparing these predictions to the measurements from a PDA. Using the method of characteristics, smaller time intervals are considered in the analysis and generally focussing on data collected from just a small number of blows. Through this comparison and analysis of the inputs to the wave equation, signal matching allows for a rough estimate of the pile base and shaft capacities. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, signal matching software (e.g. CAPWAP, IMPACT) are primarily *interpretative* tools whereas driveability software (GRLWEAP, AllWave) are *predictive* tools."
