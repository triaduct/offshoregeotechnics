    "Clearly, we have zero issues here with the horizontal capacity. Generally, drained conditions in sand don't pose an issue to horizontal stability. However, the horizontal capacity begins to become more critical in undrained scenarios. Of course, this will include foundation capacity in clay, however, undrained scenarios can even occur in sands under the short duration of a single wave load. Therefore both drained and undrained checks are recommended when performing a full foundation calculation. \n",
