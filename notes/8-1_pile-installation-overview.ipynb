    "Driveability assessments are especially important offshore. Generally only one or two shipping vessels are used during pile installation, delivering the piles often tens of kilometres away (if not hundreds of kilometres) from the nearest port and manufacturing plant. Therefore it's essential that installation goes as smooth as possible since driving delays can result in significant financial overspends due to vessel downtime.\n",

    "As part of a driveability study, the likelihood of certain risks occurring needs to be evaluated. This include risks such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Pile damage**: cracks, deformation, or buckling of the pile can occur if the driving energy is too high or when driving through dense sands and gravels, which can render the pile unusable. \n",
    "* **Pile run**: this is a phenomenon where the pile accelerates unexpectedly due to the weight of the pile-hammer system exceeding the soil resistance, potentially causing rapid penetration and inducing shock loads on the crane rigging.  \n",
    "* **Premature refusal**: inefficient pile driving or unforeseen soil profiles can result in a pile not reaching its required depth or capacity, potentially compromising the foundation's integrity. \n",
    "* **Inefficient equipment**: using driving equipment that is not suited for the soil conditions or project requirements can lead to inefficient installation and increased risk of damage. \n",
    "* **Impact on marine life**: offshore pile driving can negatively affect marine mammals and other wildlife through noise and vibrations.\n",

    "With this in mind are many different ways of characterising the loudness of a sound wave (e.g. @fig-sound-wave). Sound pressure essentially indicates the intensity or loudness of a sound wave. While sound pressure itself is reported in Pascals (Pa), often the sound pressure level (in dB) is used. \n",
    "\n",
    "![A simple sound wave and three simple methods to characterise the loudness of a sound signal [(source)](https://dosits.org/science/advanced-topics/sound-pressure-levels-and-sound-exposure-levels/)](pics/installation/sound-wave.jpg){#fig-sound-wave width=80%}\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {.callout-note}\n",
    "Sound intensity (in decibels, dB) is relative measurement, meaning a reference intensity is used for whatever medium is being considered. As a result, sound intensity measurements in water are not comparable to intensity measurements in air.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, it's important note that the decimal system is also on a logarithmic scale. \n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "The noise from installing offshore foundations can significantly affect animal behaviour as well as lead to substantial hearing damage, or even death. Impact driving is particularly damaging as it creates short yet high peak sound pressures known as impulsive sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "With the highly time-dependent nature of sound wave propagation in mind, there are several ways of recording or portraying sound pressure measurements. A couple of common measurements in the offshore industry include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Peak sound pressure level $L_{p,pk}$**, which is the same as the zero-to-peak sound pressure shown in @fig-sound-wave.\n",
    "* **Sound equivalent level (SEL)** corresponds to the continuous sound pressure level, normalising it to a duration of one second and with the same acoustic energy as the impulse. This is generally the best measurement of pile driving, since it captures the full energy received from the acoustic source. \n",
    "\n",
    "An example of some acoustic measurements is shown in @fig-bellmann-measurements. Clearly, pile diameter has a strong effect on the sound pressures generated---particularly at small pile diameters. Nevertheless, there's also other effects that will affect noise propagation that may also create the variation shown in @fig-bellmann-measurements, like water depth or the soil conditions themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an example of some regulatory limits, Germany has quite strict regulations in this regard, where $L_{p,pk}$ may not exceed 190 dB and SEL may not exceed 160 dB. Given that most pile installations exceed these limits (@fig-bellmann-measurements), the need for noise mitigation measures is almost guaranteed on most projects in Germany. \n",

    "\n",
    "If works cannot be avoided, then there are also several mitigation measures which could help reduce (but not entirely remove) the level of noise generated. These can be classified as either primary or secondary measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Primary measures** reduce the noise emission at the source. This can be achieved through modifications of the piling process (e.g. adjusting the piling energy, use of alternative hammer technologies) or by using a different foundation system such as a shallow foundation or an anchored, floating turbine. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Secondary measures** reduce the noise that has propagated through the water column. This may be achieved by \"noise abatement systems\". These systems often don't require any geotechnical design, although there some exceptions include large screens or casings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lastly, another class of systems include acoustic deterrence systems, which emit an acoustic wave of a particular frequency to deter specific species away from the site."

    "\n",
    "At a basic level, a hammer consists of a large steel block known as a ram. The ram is hoisted up to a certain height and then dropped onto a steel cap known as an anvil. This anvil then distributes the kinetic energy over the entire pile head, ideally avoid any excessive localised stresses in the pile. \n",
    "\n",
    "An energy source is needed to lift this ram. While both hydraulic and diesel-powered hammers are often seen onshore---generally only hydraulic hammers are used offshore. These hammers can also be used underwater, which can be particularly useful for installing jacket piles deep below the sea surface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Hydraulic hammers work by using a hydraulic piston to lift the ram a set distance above the pile. At the highest point, the return valves are opened and the ram falls under its own weight by gravitaional accelaration. Additional force may also be provided by the compressed gas, allowing for some hammers to reach ram accelerations of $2g$.\n",
