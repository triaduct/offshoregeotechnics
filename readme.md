## CIEM 2301: Offshore Geotechnics

This collection of Jupyter notebooks is a set of learning materials for the course CIEM2301 Offshore Geotechnics at Delft University of Technology. The aim is to provide an interactive and accessible way of engaging with the course material, essentially acting as a virtual laboratory. The rendered website can be viewed via https://triaduct.github.io/offshoregeotechnics/.

The site has been rendered using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and is hosted through Github Pages.

For more information, check out `guide.qmd`. Some Python scripts that are used in the course have also been included in `utils`. These scripts mainly come from `CPyT` (https://github.com/triaduct/cpyt), however, since these arent available on PyPi yet, I have just included some here for convenience.
